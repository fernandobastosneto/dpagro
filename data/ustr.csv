It further announced that the procurement of foreign goods would be permitted only with special authorization at the ministerial level and if a locally made product could not be identified. Algeria requires approval from the Council of Ministers for expenditures in foreign currency that exceed 10 billion Algerian dinars (approximately $87 million). In 2017, this requirement delayed payments to at least one U.S. company.

The United States acknowledges the steps Algeria has taken to raise awareness of IP issues, as well as Algeria’s engagement with the United States on improving IP protection and enforcement. However, significant IP-related concerns remain, particularly regarding the enforcement of anti-piracy statutes, such as those aimed at combating the use of unlicensed software.

BARRIERS TO DIGITAL TRADE,"In May 2018, Algeria signed into law legislation requiring electronic commerce platforms conducting business in Algeria to register with the government and to host their websites from a data center located in Algeria. Such localization requirements impose unnecessary costs on service suppliers, particularly foreign firms, which are more likely to depend on globally distributed data centers. Algeria permits citizens to purchase goods from outside the country using international credit cards, with a maximum value per transaction of DZD 100,000 (approximately $776). Algerian foreign exchange regulations prohibit the use of certain online payment processors to transfer money from one account to another.",1,ALGERIA
INVESTMENT BARRIERS,"Prior to 2020, Algeria’s investment law required Algerian ownership of at least 51 percent in all projects involving foreign investments. On June 3, 2020, the Complementary Finance Law amended the investment law to limit the 51 percent requirement to strategic sectors, which include mining, upstream energy activities, industries related to the military, transportation infrastructure, and pharmaceutical production. As there is no single process for registering foreign investments, prospective investors must work with the ministry or ministries relevant to a particular project to negotiate, register, and set up their businesses. U.S. businesses have commented that the process is subject to political influence and that a lack of transparency in the decision-making process makes it difficult to determine the reasons for any delays. The 2020 book of government-modified specifications the automotive industry increased domestic for content requirements. Minimum local integration rates for domestic assembly plants will now be 30 percent in the first year, 35 percent after three years, 40 percent after four years, and 50 percent after five years. Additionally, the book of specifications mandates that automotive importers be 100 percent Algerian- owned, and retroactively excludes foreign companies from holding ownership stakes in importation companies and dealerships. Algerian bureaucratic requirements cause significant delays and deter many companies from attempting to enter the market.

GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT,"Angola’s government procurement process lacks transparency and fails to promote competition among suppliers. Information about government procurement is often not readily available from the appropriate authorities, despite the creation of a publicly accessible electronic procurement portal and a requirement that bids for procurement allocated for in the annual state budget be advertised in the government newspaper. On December 23, 2020, the Angolan National Assembly approved Law No. 41/20, revising its Public Procurement Law (PPL) and revoking Law 9/16 of June 16, 2016. The revised PPL entered into force on January 22, 2021. The new law seeks to increase transparency in public resources utilization and to simplify procedures in public works and public services procurement, as well as the acquisition of goods by public entities. The most important changes presented by the law include encouraging administrative concessions regarding the granting of rights, land or property related to public works, public services, and exploration of the public domain. The law also calls for such contracts to be carried out though public-private- partnerships. The law also provides that public procurement contract values in the amount of at least 500 million Kwanzas (approximately $770,000) or more be approved by the President of the Republic and submitted to the Tribunal de Contas (Supreme Audit Institution) for oversight. FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 15 The new law introduces two new procurement procedures. The first is the Dynamic Electronic Procedure, which provides for the public acquisition of standard goods and services using an electronic platform. Any interested party that is properly registered may participate. The second spells out the procedure for emergency procurement, such as those required during a state of calamity or during a pandemic, such as COVID-19. A punitive clause for the most serious breaches of contract by an individual or corporation party to such contracts contains fines ranging from $1,650 to $3,300 for individuals, and $6,600 to $15,300 for corporations. Through the revised and simplified PPL Angola seeks to expand local investment and also attract more foreign direct investment. Angola also expects that the PPL will reduce corruption, nepotism, and fraud, while increasing competitiveness and improving the Angolan business environment. The United States will monitor implementation and enforcement of the law in light of the continued weak state of institutions and the lack of necessary technical capacity to implement and enforce laws.

INVESTMENT BARRIERS,"A leading business challenge in Angola remains the scarcity of foreign exchange, and the resulting inability of foreign investors to repatriate profits and Angolan companies to pay foreign suppliers. The lack of foreign exchange is significantly impeding imports of products to this heavily import dependent market. International and domestic companies operating in Angola face significant delays securing foreign exchange approval for remittances to cover key operational expenses, including to import goods and expatriate salaries. Profit and dividend remittances are even more problematic for most companies. However, oil companies with Angolan exploration and production rights began selling foreign exchange directly to Angolan commercial banks on January 2, 2020. The decision ended a five-year policy that ensured that the international oil companies sold $240 million in foreign exchange monthly to the BNA, which in turn resold to commercial banks in monthly and eventually daily auctions. On August 10, 2018, the Angolan Government enacted a private investment law aimed at facilitating investment. The law removed the previous requirement that foreign investors identify a local partner with a 35 percent stake prior to investing in priority sectors, thereby allowing foreign investors to own investments in their entirety. The law also eliminated minimum levels of foreign direct investment and established firm sunset clauses for tax incentives. In addition to changes to the investment legal framework, the government created the Agency for Private Investment and Exports Promotion, a state-run agency with the goal of facilitating investment and export processes. The law, however, does not apply to investment in the petroleum, diamond, and financial sectors, which remain governed by sector-specific legislation. For example, legislation for the petroleum sector requires most foreign oil services companies to form joint venture partnerships with local companies. Foreign petroleum companies also face local content requirements requiring them to acquire low capital investment goods and services from Angolan-owned companies.

Bribery and Corruption,"Corruption remains prevalent in Angola for reasons including an inadequately trained civil service, a highly centralized bureaucracy, a lack of funding to improve capacity, and a lack of uniform implementation of anticorruption laws. “Gratuities” and other facilitation fees often are requested to secure quicker service and approval. It is common for Angolan Government officials to have substantial private business interests that are not publicly disclosed. Likewise, it is difficult to determine the ownership of some Angolan companies and the ownership structures of banks. Access to investment opportunities and public financing continues to favor those connected to the government and the ruling party.

Foreign Exchange,"The BNA issued Notice no. 17/20 of August 3, 2020, approving new rules and procedures governing foreign exchange transactions applicable to individuals. Among other amendments, effective September 2, 2020, foreign employees working in Angola must open a local bank account into which income from their employer will be deposited in local currency; employers may no longer transfer remunerations to foreign employees’ accounts abroad. However, a foreign employee may purchase foreign currency upon presentation of a valid employment agreement and work permit. Under the notice, Angolan banking institutions should also verify that the employee income was transferred by a tax compliant employer. Foreign exchange control applies in most international trade operations related to payments for imports and is subject to pre-authorization from the National Bank of Angola (BNA). In June 2018, the BNA announced that letters of credit would be the preferred financial instrument for import and export transactions, and mandatory for all international trade transactions above €100,000 (approximately $112,500).

Non-Arab League Countries,"In recent years, press reports have occasionally surfaced regarding the implementation of officially- sanctioned boycotts of trade with Israel by governments of non-Arab League countries, particularly some member states of the 57-member Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), headquartered in Saudi Arabia. (Arab League and OIC memberships overlap to a degree, though the OIC membership is geographically and culturally much more diverse.) Information gathered by U.S. embassies in various non- Arab League OIC member states does not paint a clear picture of whether the OIC enforces its own boycott of Israel (as opposed to lending support to Arab League positions). The degree to which non-Arab League OIC member states enforce any aspect of a boycott against Israel also appears to vary widely. Bangladesh, for example, does impose a primary boycott on trade with Israel. By contrast, OIC members Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan impose no boycotts on trade with Israel and in some cases have actively encouraged such trade.

Second, there is inadequate protection against unfair commercial use and unauthorized disclosure of undisclosed test and other data submitted to the Argentine Government in conjunction with its lengthy marketing approval process. In addition, the United States encourages Argentina to provide transparency and procedural fairness to all interested parties in connection with potential recognition or protection of geographical indications, including in connection with trade agreement negotiations. Finally, the patent pendency backlog continues to result in unreasonable delays. In addition, the absence of sustained enforcement efforts – including under criminal laws – sufficient to have a deterrent effect, coupled with judicial inefficiency and outdated intellectual property (IP) laws, diminishes the competitiveness of U.S. IP-intensive industries in Argentina. For example, “La Salada,” continues to be one of South America’s largest black markets for counterfeit and pirated goods.

Non-commercial courier shipments with a value of $1,000 or less and a weight not greater than 50 kilograms are exempt from import licensing and other import requirements, subject to certain conditions, including an annual limit of five shipments per person. Due to significant import-related delays and lack of transparency, such as non-automatic import licenses, the express and postal channels are essential for electronic commerce.

As of September 15, 2020, pursuant to Communication A71067/2020, Argentine nationals and residents can make purchases in foreign currency equal to no more than $200 per month. Purchases abroad with credit and debit cards count against the $200 monthly quota. Although no limit on credit or debit card purchases is imposed, if monthly expenses surpass the $200 quota the deduction, corresponding to the amount of excess spending, will be carried over to subsequent months until the total amount is covered. Also, the regulation prohibits individuals from receiving government assistance and high-ranking government officials from purchasing foreign currency. Individuals must receive Central Bank approval to purchase foreign currency in excess of the $200 quota. Pursuant to Public Emergency Law 27,541, issued December 23, 2019, all purchases denominated in foreign currency and individual expenses incurred abroad, in person or online, including international online purchases from Argentina, paid with credit or debit cards issued by Argentine banks, are subject to a 30 percent tax. AFIP Resolution 4815 imposes an additional 35 percent withholding tax that may be deducted from an individual’s income or wealth tax obligation. Non-Argentine residents are required to obtain prior Central Bank approval to purchase in foreign currency in excess of $100 per month, except for certain bilateral or international organizations, institutions and agencies, diplomatic representation, and foreign tribunals. As of October 2019, Communication A6815 limits cash withdrawals made abroad with local debit cards to only foreign currency bank accounts owned by the client in Argentina. Pursuant to Communication A6823, cash advances made abroad from local credit cards are limited to a maximum of $50 per transaction. Companies and individuals will need to obtain prior clearance from the Central Bank before transferring funds abroad, including dividend payments or other distributions abroad, or to pay for services rendered to a company by foreign affiliates. If transfers are made from their own foreign currency accounts in Argentina to their own accounts abroad, individuals do not need to obtain Central Bank approval. Through Communication A6869 issued by the Central Bank in January 2020, companies will be able to repatriate dividends without Central Bank authorization equivalent to a maximum of 30 percent of new foreign direct investment (FDI) made by the company in the country. To promote FDI, the Central Bank announced in Communication A7123 in October 2020 that it will allow free access to the official foreign exchange market to repatriate investments, provided that the capital contribution was transferred and sold in Argentine pesos FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 33 through the foreign exchange market as of October 2, 2020 and that the repatriation takes place at least two years after the transfer and settlement of those funds. Exporters of goods are required to transfer to Argentina and settle in pesos in the foreign currency market the proceeds from exports made as of September 2, 2019. Exporters must settle according to the following terms: exporters with affiliates (irrespective of the type of good exported) and exporters of certain goods (including certain cereals, seeds, minerals, and precious metals) must convert their foreign currency proceeds to pesos within 15 days (or 30 days for some products) after the issuance of the permit for shipment; other exporters have 180 days to settle in pesos. Irrespective of these deadlines, exporters must comply with the obligation to transfer the funds to Argentina and settle in pesos within five days from the actual collection. Pursuant to Decree 661 issued in September 2019, all export tax refunds are subject to liquidation in the local foreign exchange market. This measure complements Decree 609/2019 that requires all proceeds from exports to be settled in Argentine pesos. Payments for imports of goods and services from third parties and from affiliates require Central Bank approval if the company needs to purchase foreign currency. Pursuant to Communication A7030 from May 2020, the Central Bank requires that importers submit an affidavit stating that the total amount of foreign currency requested (including the current payment request) does not exceed the amount of the payments for purchases by that importer and cleared by customs between January 1, 2020, and the day prior to accessing the foreign exchange market. The total amount of payments for import of goods should also include the payments for amortizations of lines of credit or commercial guarantees. Argentine residents are required to transfer to Argentina and settle in pesos the proceeds from services exports rendered to non-Argentine residents that are paid in foreign currency, either in Argentina or abroad, within five business days from collection thereof. In September 2020, the Central Bank issued Circular A7106, limiting companies’ ability to purchase foreign currency to repay any external financial debt (including intercompany debt) and dollar-denominated local securities. Companies will have access to no more than 40 percent of the principal amount coming due from October 15, 2020 to March 1, 2021, and for the remaining 60 percent of the debt, the company must file a refinancing plan with the Central Bank.

Export Policies,"Argentina maintains export taxes on most exports of goods and services. As of December 14, 2019, when Decree 37/2019 came into effect, the Argentine Government set the export tax rate on goods at 12 percent, with several exceptions. Products listed in Annex II of Decree 37 are subject to a 9 percent export tax. Products that were listed in Annex II of Decree 793, issued September 4, 2018, but that were not also included in Annex II of Decree 37/2019, are required to pay an export tax of three Argentine pesos per dollar exported. On December 23, 2019, when Public Emergency Law 27,541 came into effect, Argentina established export tax ceilings on exports of certain agricultural commodities, industrial products, oil, gas, minerals, and services. In the case of exports of services, the maximum tax that applies is 5 percent. Micro and small enterprises exporting less than $600,000 in services per year are exempted from the tax, and those exporting more than $600,000 are required to pay the export tax on exports above the $600,000 threshold. Goods produced in and exported from the Special Customs Area (SCA) located in Tierra del Fuego province are exempt from export taxes. Argentina maintains additional percentage-based export taxes on a range of products.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION,"Australia generally provides strong intellectual property protection and enforcement through legislation that, among other things, criminalizes copyright piracy and trademark counterfeiting. Under the FTA, Australia must notify a pharmaceutical product patent owner of a request for marketing approval by a third party for a product claimed by that patent owner. Australia must also provide measures in its marketing approval process to prevent persons other than the patent owner from marketing a patented product during the patent term. U.S. and Australian pharmaceutical companies have expressed concerns about delays in this notification process. In October 2020, the Australian Government announced planned reforms to the notification procedures for pharmaceutical products that are under evaluation. These reforms, if fully implemented, could increase transparency and promote the early resolution of potential pharmaceutical patent disputes. These reforms require legislation to be passed and implemented; however, no legislation had been introduced in Australia’s parliament as of March 2021.

Audiovisual Services,"The Australian Content Standard of 2005 requires commercial television broadcasters to produce and screen Australian content. Broadcasting content requirements include an annual minimum Australian content quota of 55 percent for transmissions between 6:00 a.m. and midnight in addition to minimum annual sub- quotas for Australian drama, documentary, and children’s programs. A broadcaster must also ensure that Australian-produced advertisements occupy at least 80 percent of the total advertising time screened between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and midnight. These local content requirements do not currently apply to cable or online programming. Australia’s Broadcasting Services Amendment Act requires subscription television channels with significant drama programming to spend ten percent of their programming budgets on new Australian drama programs. This local content requirement applies to cable and satellite services but does not apply to new digital multi-channels or to online programming. In September 2020, the Minister for Communications announced that the Australian Government will introduce changes to local content requirements. This will include legislation to reduce the Australian content spend requirements for subscription television channels to five percent, down from the current ten percent. Australia will also require streaming video services to report to the media regulator on Australian content acquisitions, beginning in 2021. The government indicated it will simultaneously investigate whether to introduce an Australian content obligation for streaming video-on-demand services above a minimum size threshold. In November 2020, the Australian Government issued the Media Reform Green Paper. The Green Paper proposes setting the “expectation” that subscription and advertising video‐on‐ demand services invest a percentage of their Australian revenue in Australian content, in the form of commissions, co‐productions, and acquisitions. If service suppliers fail to meet investment expenditure “expectations” for two consecutive years, then the Minister of Communications will have the power to implement regulatory requirements. The United States will continue to monitor this issue to ensure compliance with Australia’s FTA obligations, which discipline measures that discriminate in favor of domestic content.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION,"Bangladesh continues to make slow progress towards establishing a comprehensive legal framework to adequately and effectively protect and enforce intellectual property (IP).

The Prime Minister’s cabinet has approved these draft bills, but before becoming law they would need to undergo review by the Law Ministry and final approval by Parliament. In addition, the Department of Patents, Designs and Trademarks (DPDT) has drafted an “Innovation & IP Policy Strategy.” However, Bangladesh failed to consult all relevant stakeholders and the policy lacks wide acceptance or support. Bangladesh devotes limited resources to IP protection and enforcement. Counterfeit and pirated goods are readily available. U.S. firms, including pharmaceutical companies, manufacturers of consumer goods, and software firms have reported violations of their IP. Investors note police are willing to investigate counterfeit goods distributors when informed but are unlikely to initiate independent investigations. In addition, right holders have raised concerns about fairness of court decisions in IP cases. Bangladesh took an encouraging step in November 2019 when its National Board of Revenue issued revised Customs Rules intended to streamline IP enforcement and prevent the importation of counterfeit products. In September 2020 in New Delhi, India, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) hosted a three- day program for Bangladeshi Customs officials and industry representatives on U.S. IP enforcement and best practices.

According to the National Telecommunication Policy, foreign investors in the telecommunications sector are encouraged to demonstrate their commitment to Bangladesh by forming joint ventures with local companies. Frequent changes to regulations and tax policy in the sector increase business uncertainty, thereby decreasing the incentive to invest. Bangladesh imposes the highest taxes on mobile telecommunications services of any country in South Asia. Under the present tax regime, the mobile industry is taxed like a supplier of luxury goods, with taxes imposed at various levels of operation. Mobile network operators pay 5.5 percent of their revenue to the BTRC as a spectrum fee, 1 percent of their revenue into a social obligation fund, and BDT 50 million (approximately $423,000) as an annual licensing fee. A tax of BDT 200 (approximately $1.70) is imposed on the sale of subscriber identification model (SIM) cards, and a ten percent supplementary duty is applied to charges for phone usage. Smartphones are subject to a 25 percent duty while all other handsets are subject to a 10 percent import duty. The corporate income tax rate for telecommunications companies listed in the Bangladeshi capital market is 40 percent, while the corporate income tax rate for mobile service providers that are not publicly listed in the Bangladesh capital market is 45 percent.

INVESTMENT BARRIERS,"Bangladesh frequently promotes local industries resulting in some discriminatory policies and regulations. In practical terms, foreign investors frequently find it necessary to have a local partner even though this requirement may not be statutorily defined. Bureaucratic inefficiencies also often discourage investment in Bangladesh. According to World Bank figures, Bangladesh’s foreign direct investment as a percentage of GDP in 2019 (latest data available) was only 0.66 percent. Overlapping administrative procedures and a lack of transparency in regulatory and administrative systems can frustrate investors seeking to undertake projects in the country. Frequent transfers of top- and mid-level officials in various Bangladeshi ministries, directorates, and departments are disruptive and prevent timely implementation of both strategic reform initiatives and routine duties. Repatriation of profits and external payments are allowed, but U.S. and other international investors have raised concerns that the procedures and requirements for outbound transfers from Bangladesh remain cumbersome and that applications to repatriate profits or dividends can be held up for additional information gathering or otherwise delayed. In June 2020, Bangladesh Bank announced that it would ease the requirements for repatriating the sales proceeds of nonresident equity investment in non-listed public limited companies and private limited companies. The Central Bank announced in July 2020 that it would enable local banks to transfer foreign investors’ dividend income into their foreign currency bank accounts, and also relaxed its oversight of remittances of dividends by foreign shareholders, allowing banks and non- bank financial institutions to extend credit facilities to foreign companies in local currency against foreign guarantees. However, U.S. insurance companies report that agency-level regulators continue to present significant obstacles to securing required approvals for remittances, which are required before insurance companies can seek central bank clearance. International companies, including U.S. companies, have raised concerns the NBR has arbitrarily reopened decades-old tax cases, particularly targeting cases involving multinational companies. In October 2018, the NBR set up a separate unit, the International Taxpayers’ Unit, to handle income tax files of foreign companies operating in Bangladesh. The unit closely scrutinizes issues related to tax avoidance and capital flight. U.S. firms are concerned they will be targeted as the Bangladesh Government seeks to increase revenues.",7,BANGLADESH

Along with the BCC, the WTO Division of the Ministry of Commerce still handles many competition-related issues. Despite the work of the BCC since 2011 and significant reforms in the domestic economy, Bangladesh still possesses a weak competition regime to address anticompetitive conduct. Although the BCC finally came into full operation in 2016, it has experienced operational delays due to a lack of staff and resources. FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 53 Sectors such as railways, telecommunications, and other public utility services have generated monopolies leading to anticompetitive structures. The Bangladeshi railway system remains a state-owned monopoly requiring large subsidies because of poor management and lack of fare enforcement.

Corruption,"Corruption is a pervasive and longstanding problem in Bangladesh. Bribery and extortion in commercial dealings are common features of business. U.S. companies have complained about long delays in obtaining approval of licenses and bids, as compared to other players. While Bangladesh has established legislation to combat bribery, embezzlement, and other forms of corruption, enforcement is inconsistent. There have been continuous efforts to water down public procurement rules and proposals to curb the independence of the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), the main institutional anticorruption watchdog. A 2013 amendment to the ACC Law removed the ACC’s authority to sue public servants without prior government permission. Parliament passed the Sarkari Chakori Ain Bill (Government Job Act) in October 2018. The Government Job Act made it mandatory for ACC to seek permission of the authorities concerned before arresting any government officer. The Government Job Act further limits the efficiency of the ACC in investigating corruption allegations against government officers. While the ACC has increased pursuit of cases against lower-level government officials and some higher-level officials, there remains a large backlog of cases. The Code of Criminal Procedure, the Prevention of Corruption Act, the Penal Code, and the Money Laundering Prevention Act criminalize attempted corruption, extortion, active and passive bribery, bribery of foreign public officials, money laundering, and using public resources or confidential state information for private gain.

GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT,"In 2004, Bolivia enacted the Buy Bolivian (Compro Boliviano) program through Supreme Decree 27328. This program supports domestic production by giving preference margins to domestic producers or suppliers in government procurement. Under procurement rules that were modified in 2007 and 2009, the government must give priority to small and micro-producers and to “campesino” or rural farmer associations in procurements under $100,000. In addition, the government requires fewer guarantees and imposes fewer requirements on Bolivian suppliers that qualify as small or micro-producers or as campesino associations. Bolivian companies also are given priority in government procurement valued between $142,000 and $5.7 million. Importers of foreign products can participate in these procurements only where locally manufactured products and local service providers are unavailable or where the Bolivian Government does not initially select a domestic supplier. In such cases, or if a procurement exceeds $5.7 million, the government can call for an international tender. There is a requirement that foreign companies submitting a tender for government consultancy contracts do so in association with a Bolivian company, but the Bolivian Government occasionally makes exceptions in strategic sectors, as defined by the government. For national and international tenders there are preference margins from 10 percent to 25 percent for Bolivian inputs. 56 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS",8,BOLIVIA

Significant challenges also persist with respect to widespread piracy and counterfeiting. As stated in years past, the Special 301 Report again encouraged Bolivia to improve its weak protection of IP.

INVESTMENT BARRIERS,"Bolivia’s constitution calls for a limit on foreign companies’ access to international arbitration in cases of conflicts with the government. The constitution also states that all Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) must be renegotiated to adjust to this and other new constitutional provisions. Citing these provisions, in June 2012, the Bolivian Government became the first U.S. BIT partner to terminate its BIT with the United States. Existing investors in Bolivia at the time of termination continue to be protected by the U.S. BIT’s provisions, though those protections will end in June 2022, 10 years after the termination of the treaty. The Bolivian Government has emphasized public ownership of strategic enterprises. In an effort to control key sectors of the economy, the government obtained (through legally required contract renegotiations) majority ownership in a number of companies in the hydrocarbons, electricity, mining, and telecommunications sectors. The Bolivian Government also has used means other than nationalization to re-establish public sector control over the economy. In the past few years, the government created dozens of public companies in “strategic” sectors such as food production, industrialization of natural resources, air travel, banking, and mining. Private sector entities expressed concern that these public companies engage in unfair subsidized competition leading to a state-driven economic system. The Bolivian constitution includes requirements for state involvement in natural resource companies. The constitution states that all natural resources shall be administered by the Government of Bolivia.

For example, Brazil allows tax- free purchases of capital goods and inputs to domestic companies that export more than 50 percent of their output. Similarly, the Reintegra program, launched in 2011 as part of Greater Brazil Plan, exempts exports of goods covered by more than 8,000 tariff lines from certain taxes, and allows Brazilian exporters to FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 63 receive up to 0.1 percent of gross receipts from exports in tax refunds.

GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT,"Brazil is not a Party to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA), but has been an observer to the WTO Committee on Government Procurement since October 2017. On May 18, 2020 Brazil submitted its application for accession to the WTO GPA and in October 2020, it submitted to the WTO GPA Committee its Replies to the Checklist of Issues as part of the accession process. In an effort to align with the WTO GPA obligations, in October 2017 the Government of Brazil adopted Normative Instruction 10, which facilitated the participation of foreign companies in government procurement tenders without the establishment of legal representation in Brazil or the requirement to provide sworn translations of incorporation documents (although these documents are required if a company is awarded a contract). By statute, a Brazilian state enterprise may subcontract services to a foreign firm only if domestic expertise is unavailable. Additionally, U.S. and other foreign firms may only bid to provide technical services where there are no qualified Brazilian firms. U.S. companies without a substantial in-country presence regularly face significant obstacles to winning government contracts and are, comparatively, more successful in serving as subcontractors to larger Brazilian firms instead. The current administration has announced plans to amend the law to allow more foreign firms to participate in the government procurement process, especially for infrastructure projects. Brazil grants procurement preference to firms that produce in Brazil and that fulfill certain economic stimulus requirements, such as generating employment or contributing to technological development, even if those firms’ bids are up to 25 percent more expensive than bids submitted by foreign firms not producing in Brazil. U.S. technology companies have concerns regarding the potentially prohibitive costs of certifying a system for an individual market. FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 65 The Brazilian National Oil and Gas Regulatory Agency (ANP) maintains minimum LCRs for all oil companies operating in Brazil’s upstream exploration and production phases, including procurement for stated-controlled companies such as Petrobras. The LCRs vary by hydrocarbon resource block (the geographic area that is awarded by the Brazilian Government to companies for oil and gas exploration), and within each block the LCRs differ for equipment, workforce, and services. Brazil reformed the LCRs for Brazil’s critical oil and gas sector in 2017. LCRs for deepwater oil and gas exploration fell by half on average, to a minimum of 18 percent – down from 37 percent for previous auctions – and LCRs for deepwater production fell to between 25 percent and 40 percent, depending on the activity, down from 55 percent. Onshore exploration and development LCRs decreased to 50 percent from 70 percent and 77 percent, respectively.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION,"Brazil remained on the Watch List in the Special 301 Report. Brazil is an increasingly important market for intellectual property- (IP) intensive industries; however, administrative and enforcement challenges continue, including high levels of counterfeiting and piracy online and in physical markets. Increased emphasis on enforcement at the tri-border region between Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay, and stronger deterrent penalties, are critical to make sustained progress on these IP concerns. The National Council on Combating Piracy and Intellectual Property Crimes has renewed activity and may again be an effective entity for carrying out public awareness and enforcement campaigns. Positive developments at the National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI) include a further reduction in application backlogs for patents, trademarks, and industrial designs, an upgrade of the agency’s information technology systems, and the digitization of patent applications. The decrease in examination times for trademark applications put Brazil in line with Madrid Protocol standards, and Brazil started receiving trademark applications through the Madrid Protocol system in October 2019, following its accession to the agreement. However, patent delays remain a concern. In July 2019, INPI implemented a plan to reduce the backlog by 80 percent by July 2021 and made progress toward that goal during 2020. In December 2019, INPI and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office put into place an updated Patent Prosecution Highway program that is technology neutral (that is, not limited by sector or type of patent). To resolve concerns about duplicative reviews by ANVISA of pharmaceutical patent applications presented before INPI, an April 2017 agreement between INPI and ANVISA redefined ANVISA’s role in order to expedite the examination of such applications. The United States will continue to monitor implementation of this agreement. In addition, the United States encourages Brazil to provide transparency and procedural fairness to all interested parties in connection with potential recognition or protection of geographical indications, including in connection with trade agreement negotiations. Furthermore, while Brazilian law and regulations provide for protection against unfair commercial use of undisclosed test results and other data generated to obtain marketing approval for veterinary and agricultural chemical products, similar protection is not provided for pharmaceutical products for human use. The United States also remains concerned about INPI’s actions to invalidate or shorten the term of a number of “mailbox” patents for pharmaceutical and agricultural chemical products. The United States will continue to engage Brazil on these and other IP-related issues. 66 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS",9,BRAZIL
SERVICES BARRIERS,Audiovisual Services,9,BRAZIL
Audiovisual Services,"Brazil imposes a fixed tax on each foreign film released in theaters, foreign home entertainment products, foreign programming for broadcast television, and foreign content and foreign advertising released on the cable and satellite channels. The taxes are significantly higher than the corresponding taxes levied on Brazilian products. In addition, 80 percent of the programming aired on “open broadcast” (non-cable) television channels must be Brazilian, and foreign ownership in print media and “open broadcast” television is limited to 30 percent. Remittances to foreign producers of audiovisual works are subject to a 25 percent income withholding tax. As an alternative to paying the full tax, producers can elect to invest 70 percent of the tax value in local independent productions. In addition, local distributors of foreign films are subject to a levy equal to 11 percent of remittances to the foreign producer. This levy, a component of the Contribution to the Development of a National Film Industry (CONDECINE) tax, is waived if the distributor agrees to invest an amount equal to three percent of the total remittances in local independent productions. Remittances for video on demand are also subject to CONDECINE and would be subject to further regulation under proposed law PL 8889/2017, which includes incentives for Brazilian production and minimum quotas for Brazilian content structured to increase progressively with company revenue. The CONDECINE levy is also assessed on foreign-produced video and audio advertising. Brazil requires that all films and television shows be printed locally by prohibiting the importation of color prints for Brazil’s theatrical and television markets. Brazil also maintains domestic film quotas for theatrical screening and home video distribution. Law 12.485 of 2011 covers the subscription television market, including satellite and cable television. The law permits telecommunication companies to offer television packages with their services and removes the previous 49 percent limit on foreign ownership of cable television companies. However, the law also imposes local content quotas by requiring every channel to air at least three and a half hours per week of Brazilian programming during prime time, and by requiring that one-third of all channels included in any television package be Brazilian. The law also makes subscription television programmers subject to the 11 percent CONDECINE levy on remittances. In addition, the law delegates significant programming and advertising regulatory authority to the national film industry development agency (ANCINE), which raises concerns about the objectivity of regulatory decisions. Brazil’s Pay TV law bans cross-ownership between distributors and content producers in Brazil’s paid- television sector. The law has been tested by a merger between two foreign entities operating in Brazil. The merged entity, based in the United States but owning an acquired Brazilian broadcaster, asserts that the law’s cross-ownership restrictions apply only to producers and programmers based in Brazil and none of its paid-television production or programming companies are headquartered in Brazil. Brazil’s antitrust regulator, the Administrative Council for Economic Defense, cleared the merger in 2017 under Brazil’s antitrust laws, and ANATEL approved the merger in February 2020. Brazil’s congress is evaluating proposals to update the Pay TV law to clarify that it would not prohibit such mergers.

GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT,"By law, government procurement must be carried out through one of four methods: bids by international competition, bids by domestic competition, price consulting, or price surveys. The criteria of each method include the minimum prices of the bids, levels of domestic resources, and technical capacity. The government has a general requirement for competitive bidding in procurements valued over KHR 100 million (approximately $25,000). In some cases, particularly for procurements valued below $1 million, advertisements and application forms are only written in the Khmer language, which may place foreign firms at a disadvantage. Procurements valued above $1 million are typically conducted entirely in English. Government procurement is often not transparent, and the Cambodian Government frequently provides short response times to public announcements of tenders, which are posted on the Ministry of Economy and Finance’s website. For construction projects, only bidders registered with the Ministry are permitted to participate in tenders. As an additional complication, differing prequalification procedures exist at the provincial level, making some bids particularly complex for prospective contractors. Irregularities in the government procurement process are common despite a strict legal requirement for audits and inspections. Despite allegations of malfeasance at a number of ministries, the Cambodian Government has taken little action to investigate irregularities. In February 2018, the government issued a new regulation on procedures to resolve complaints about irregularities in government procurement.

While Cambodia has made significant progress in formalizing its tax regime and increasing tax revenues, reports suggest that the General Department of Taxation’s methods can be very burdensome on tax- compliant companies, hitting some companies with exorbitant, unexplained, or arbitrary tax bills and freezing assets for failure to pay purported back taxes. Additional concerns range from surprise tax audits to a lack of industry consultation when implementing the new tax code to a subjective application of taxes that could favor local industry over international investors.",12,CAMBODIA

Bribery and Corruption,"Both foreign and local businesses have identified corruption in Cambodia as a major obstacle to business and a deterrent to investment, with Cambodia’s judiciary viewed as one of the country’s most corrupt institutions. In 2010, Cambodia adopted anti-corruption legislation and established a national Anti- Corruption Unit (ACU) to undertake investigations, implement law enforcement measures, and conduct public outreach. Enforcement, however, remains inconsistent. The ACU’s participation in investigations of political opponents of the ruling party has tarnished its reputation as an unbiased enforcer of rules. The independence of the ACU is difficult to ascertain since the Chair and Vice Chair are chosen by the Prime Minister, and the remaining officials are appointed by various government entities. Cambodia began publishing official fees for public services at the end of 2012 in an effort to combat “facilitation payments,” but this exercise had yet to be completed as of the end of 2020. After national elections in July 2013, certain agencies, such as the Ministry of Commerce and the General Department of Taxation, started providing online information and services in an effort to reduce paperwork and unofficial fees. In addition, anti-corruption information has been incorporated into the national high school curriculum, and civil servants’ salaries are disbursed through commercial banks. Businesses have noted that signing an anti-corruption memorandum of understanding with the ACU has helped them avoid paying “facilitation payments.”",12,CAMBODIA

The United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement,"On January 29, 2020, the President signed legislation implementing the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA). The USMCA entered into force July 1, 2020, modernizing and replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The USMCA maintains the zero tariffs among the three countries that were in place under the NAFTA. The USMCA is a mutually beneficial win for North American farmers, ranchers, businesses, and workers that will support high-paying jobs for Americans and help grow the U.S. economy. It modernizes and rebalances U.S. trade relations with Canada and Mexico to benefit American workers and businesses, including by providing strong, enforceable labor and environmental obligations in the core text of the Agreement. The USMCA upgrades the NAFTA in a number of key areas, including by expanding U.S. access in Canada for certain U.S. dairy, poultry, and egg products, and by establishing some of the strongest and most advanced provisions on intellectual property rights (IP) and digital trade ever included in a trade agreement. Finally, it also includes a number of ground-breaking provisions to combat non-market practices that have the potential to disadvantage U.S. workers and businesses, such as currency manipulation and the provision of subsidies to state-owned enterprises. The USMCA contains provisions designed to address several longstanding trade-related irritants with Canada. For example, it includes obligations to strengthen enforcement against counterfeiting and piracy, satellite and cable signal theft, transparency with respect to new geographical indications (GIs), and copyright protection and enforcement in the digital environment. The USMCA also disciplines data localization measures for services providers and financial services providers. Finally, under the Agreement, Canada agreed to eliminate milk classes 6 and 7 and discriminatory grading of U.S. wheat. FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 83",13,CANADA

The EIA noted that any bidding company involved in a “trade remedy action” against a product manufactured in Canada would have its bid subject to the EIA, which may result in a deduction on the final score of the bid. The move was broadly interpreted as a response to Boeing’s 2017 trade remedy action against Canada’s Bombardier, and a warning to other companies that might pursue trade remedy actions against Canadian firms.

Audiovisual Services,"The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) imposes quotas that determine both the minimum Canadian programming expenditure (CPE) and the minimum amount of Canadian programming that licensed Canadian broadcasters must carry (Exhibition Quota). Large English- language private broadcaster groups have a CPE obligation equal to 30 percent of the group’s gross revenues from their conventional signals, specialty, and pay services. In March 2015, the CRTC eliminated the overall 55 percent daytime Canadian-content quota. Nonetheless, CRTC maintained the Exhibition Quota for primetime at 50 percent from 6:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. Specialty services and pay television services that are not part of a large English-language private broadcasting group are now subject to a 35 percent requirement throughout the day, with no prime-time quota. For cable television and direct-to-home broadcast services, more than 50 percent of the channels received by subscribers must be Canadian channels. Non-Canadian channels must be pre-approved (“listed”) by the CRTC. Upon an appeal from a Canadian licensee, the CRTC may determine that a non-Canadian channel competes with a Canadian pay or specialty service, in which case the CRTC may either remove the non- Canadian channel from the list (thereby revoking approval to supply the service) or shift the channel into a less competitive location on the channel dial. Alternatively, non-Canadian channels can become Canadian by ceding majority equity control to a Canadian partner, as some U.S. channels have done. The United States is monitoring Canada’s implementation of USMCA commitments to allow for the cross- border supply of U.S. home-shopping programming. The CRTC also requires that 35 percent of popular musical selections broadcast on the radio qualify as “Canadian” under a Canadian Government-determined point system. The CRTC’s Wholesale Code entered into force in January 2016 and governs certain commercial arrangements between distributors (e.g., cable companies) and programmers (e.g., channel owners). The Code is binding for vertically integrated suppliers in Canada (i.e., suppliers that own infrastructure and programming) and applies as guidelines to foreign programming suppliers (who by definition cannot be vertically integrated, as foreign suppliers are prohibited from owning video distribution infrastructure in Canada). U.S. broadcasters have complained about Canadian cable and satellite suppliers picking up the signals of U.S. stations near the border and redistributing them throughout Canada without the U.S. broadcasters’ consent. Content owners (including broadcasters who develop their own programming) can apply for compensation for the use of such content in Canada from a statutorily mandated fund into which Canadian cable and satellite suppliers pay. However, U.S. broadcasters consider this compensation, which was recently reduced, to be insufficient, and have sought the right to negotiate the carriage of their signals on commercially set rates and terms, as can be done in the United States. The United States will continue to explore avenues to address these concerns.",13,CANADA

Canada has a transition period of one year after entry- into-force to bring its measures into conformity with the USMCA data provisions. The Canadian Government noted in its “Canadian Statement on Implementation” online publication that the Department of Finance, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, and the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation will work during the one-year transition period to develop the necessary regulations to ensure compliance with respect to eligible foreign financial institutions that elect to store their records outside of Canada.",13,CANADA

In addition, the Province of Quebec introduced draft privacy legislation Bill 64 in June 2020 that would only permit public and private sector entities (with limited exceptions) to transmit personal data outside of the province to jurisdictions with a level of protection equivalent to Quebec’s privacy law. The United States has urged Canada to ensure that these (and any other) legislative proposals do not place restrictions on the cross-border transfer of data that would conflict with the obligations set forth in USMCA, and will continue to monitor proposals and measures in effect at both the federal and provincial levels to ensure that cross-border transfer of data are not restricted in a manner inconsistent with Canada’s trade obligations.

NON-TARIFF MEASURES,Industrial Policies,15,CHINA
Industrial Policies,"China continues to pursue a wide array of industrial policies that seek to limit market access for imported goods, foreign manufacturers, and foreign services suppliers, while offering substantial government guidance, resources, and regulatory support to Chinese industries. The beneficiaries of these constantly evolving policies are not only state-owned enterprises (SOEs) but also other domestic companies attempting to move up the economic value chain. One of the more far-reaching and harmful industrial plans is known as “Made in China 2025”. China’s State Council released this industrial plan in May 2015. It is a ten-year plan targeting ten strategic sectors, including advanced information technology, automated machine tools and robotics, aviation and spaceflight equipment, maritime engineering equipment and high-tech vessels, advanced rail transit equipment, new energy vehicles (NEVs), power equipment, farm machinery, new materials, biopharmaceuticals, and advanced medical device products. While ostensibly intended simply to raise industrial productivity through more advanced and flexible manufacturing techniques, Made in China 2025 is emblematic of an evolving and increasingly sophisticated approach to “indigenous innovation,” which is also evident in numerous supporting and related industrial plans. Their common, overriding aim is to replace foreign technologies, products, and services with Chinese technologies, products, and services in the China market and, with this foundation, to enable Chinese companies to dominate international markets. Made in China 2025 seeks to build up Chinese companies in the ten targeted, strategic sectors at the expense of, and to the detriment of, foreign industries and their technologies through a multi-step process over ten years. The initial goal of Made in China 2025 is to ensure, through various means, that Chinese companies develop, extract, or acquire their own technology, IP, and know-how and their own brands. The next goal of Made in China 2025 is to substitute domestic technologies, products, and services for foreign technologies, products, and services in the China market. The final goal of Made in China 2025 is to capture much larger worldwide market shares in the 10 targeted, strategic sectors. Many of the policy tools being used by China to achieve the goals of Made in China 2025 raise serious concerns. These tools include a wide array of state intervention and support designed to promote the 96 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS",15,CHINA
State-owned Enterprises,"While many provisions in China’s WTO accession agreement indirectly discipline the activities of state- owned and state-invested enterprises, China also agreed to some specific disciplines. In particular, it agreed that laws, regulations, and other measures relating to the purchase of goods or services for commercial sale by state-owned and state-invested enterprises, or relating to the production of goods or supply of services for commercial sale or for non-governmental purposes by state-owned and state-invested enterprises, would be subject to WTO rules. China also affirmatively agreed that state-owned and state-invested enterprises would have to make purchases and sales based solely on commercial considerations, such as price, quality, marketability, and availability, and that the Chinese Government would not influence the commercial decisions of state-owned and state-invested enterprises. In subsequent bilateral dialogues with the United States, China made further commitments. In particular, China committed to develop a market environment of fair competition for enterprises of all kinds of ownership and to provide them with non-discriminatory treatment in terms of credit provision, taxation incentives, and regulatory policies. However, instead of adopting measures giving effect to its commitments, China instead established the State Owned Asset Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) and adopted the Law on State- owned Assets of Enterprises as well as numerous other measures mandating state ownership and control of FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 97 many important industrial sectors. The Chinese Communist Party also received a decisive role in state- owned and state-invested enterprises’ major business decisions, personnel changes, project arrangements, and movement of funds. These measures enable the Chinese Government and the Party to intervene in these enterprises’ business strategies, management, and investments, to ensure that they play a dominant role in the national economy to develop China’s “socialist market economy” and China’s industrial plans. Separately, the Chinese Government also has issued a number of measures that restrict the ability of state- owned and state-invested enterprises to accept foreign investment, particularly in key sectors. Some of these measures are discussed below in the Investment section and include restrictions on foreign investment in state-owned and state-invested enterprises operating not only in the public sector but also in China’s private sector. In its 2013 Third Plenum Decision, China endorsed a number of far-reaching economic reform pronouncements, which called for making the market “decisive” in allocating resources, reducing Chinese Government intervention in the economy, accelerating China’s opening up to foreign goods and services, and improving transparency and the rule of law to allow fair competition in China’s market. It also called for reforming China’s SOEs. An example of these reform efforts included China’s announcement that it would classify these enterprises into commercial, strategic, or public interest categories and require commercial state-owned and state- invested enterprises to garner reasonable returns on capital. But this plan also allowed for divergence from commercially driven results to meet broadly construed national security interests, including energy, food, resource, cyber and information security interests, and public service requirements. Similarly, in recent years, China has pursued reforms through efforts to realize “mixed ownership.” These efforts included pressuring private companies to invest in, or merge with, state-owned and state-invested enterprises as a way to inject innovative practices and create new opportunities for inefficient state-owned and state-invested enterprises. China has also previously indicated that it would consider adopting the principle of “competitive neutrality” for SOEs. However, China has continued to pursue policies that further enshrine the dominant role of the state and its industrial plans when it comes to the operation of state-owned and state-invested enterprises. For example, China has adopted rules ensuring that the Chinese Government continues to have full authority over how state-owned and state-invested enterprises use allocations of state capital and over the projects that SOEs pursue. Overall, while China’s efforts at times have appeared to signal a high-level determination to accelerate needed economic reforms for state-owned and state-invested enterprises in order to make them operate on the same terms as private commercial operators, those reforms have not materialized. It seems clear that China’s past policy initiatives were not designed to reduce the presence of state-owned and state-invested enterprises in China’s economy, nor to force them to compete on the same terms as private companies. Rather, the reform objectives were to consolidate and to strengthen state-owned and state-invested enterprises and to place them on a more competitive footing, both in China and globally, through continued provision of preferential access to state capital, and the use of other policies and practices designed to give them artificial advantages over their private competitors. This unfair situation is compounded for foreign companies as both China’s state-owned and state-invested enterprises and China’s private companies benefit from a wide array of other state intervention and support designed to promote the development of Chinese industry. These intervention and support work, in large part, by restricting, taking advantage of, discriminating against or otherwise creating disadvantages for foreign companies and their technologies, products, and services. 98 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS",15,CHINA
Industrial Subsidies,"China continues to provide substantial subsidies to its domestic industries, which have caused injury to U.S. industries. Some of these subsidies also appear to be prohibited under WTO rules. As of March 2021, the United States has been able to address some of these subsidies through countervailing duty proceedings conducted by the U.S. Department of Commerce and dispute settlement cases at the WTO. The United States and other WTO Members also have continued to press China to notify all of its subsidies to the WTO",15,CHINA
Fisheries Subsidies,"China’s subsidies to the fisheries sector have been estimated to exceed $4 billion annually, which is particularly troubling given the role that harmful fisheries subsidies play in contributing to overfishing and overcapacity that threatens global fish stocks. Indeed, China is the world’s largest producer of marine capture fisheries, and in the years since its WTO accession, China has continued to support its fishing fleet through subsidies and other market-distorting means. Its annual fisheries harvest has grown to nearly double that of other top producers in terms of marine capture. At the same time, Chinese-flagged fishing vessels repeatedly have been reported to have engaged in illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing in distant waters, including in areas under the jurisdiction of other WTO members. While China has made some progress in reducing subsidies to domestic fisheries, it continues to shift some of its overcapacity to international fisheries by providing a much higher rate of subsidy support to its distant water fishery enterprises. The United States continues to raise its long-standing concerns over China’s fisheries subsidies programs. In 2015, the United States submitted a written request for information pursuant to Article 25.8 of the WTO",15,CHINA
Excess Capacity,"Because of its state-led approach to the economy, China is the world’s leading creator of non-economic capacity, as evidenced by the severe and persistent excess capacity situations in several industries, including, for example, steel, aluminum, solar panels, and fishing. China is also well on its way to creating severe excess capacity in other industries through its pursuit of industrial plans such as Made in China 2025, pursuant to which China is doling out hundreds of billions of dollars to support Chinese companies–––at the expense of imports–––and global market share in each of 10 advanced manufacturing industries. In manufacturing industries such as steel and aluminum, China’s economic planners have contributed to massive excess capacity in China through various government support measures. For steel, the resulting over-production has distorted global markets, harming U.S. manufacturers and workers in both the U.S. market and third country markets, where U.S. exports compete with Chinese exports. While China has publicly acknowledged excess capacity in these industries, among others, it has yet to take meaningful steps to address the root causes of this problem in a sustainable way. Currently, China’s steelmaking capacity represents roughly one-half of global capacity and more than twice the combined capacity of the EU, Japan, the United States, and Brazil. China’s steel production climbed above 1 billion metric tons for the first time in 2020, reaching 1,053 million metric tons, a 5.3 percent increase from 2019, despite a significant contraction in global steel demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This sustained ballooning of steel production, combined with rising steel inventories in China and recent measures to incentivize steel exports, threatens to flood the global market with excess steel supply at a time when the steel sector outside China is still recovering from the severe COVID-19 pandemic-related demand shock. China remains by far the world’s largest exporter of steel, exporting in 2019 roughly double the quantity of steel exported by Japan, the world’s second largest steel exporter. Similarly, primary aluminum production capacity in China increased by more than 1,500 percent between 2000 and 2020, with China accounting for more than 80 percent of global capacity growth during that period. Much of this capacity addition has been built with support by the Chinese Government. China’s primary aluminum capacity now accounts for more than 57 percent of global capacity and is more than double the capacity of the next ten aluminum-producing countries combined. As in the steel sector, China’s aluminum production has also ballooned in recent years, including through 2020, as China’s aluminum production has continued to increase despite global demand shocks. China’s capacity and production continue to contribute to major imbalances and price distortions in global markets, harming U.S. aluminum producers and workers. Excess capacity in China hurts various U.S. industries and workers not only through direct exports from China to the United States, but also through its impact on global prices and supply, which makes it difficult for competitive manufacturers throughout the world to remain viable. Indeed, domestic industries in many of China’s trading partners continue to petition their governments to impose trade measures to respond to the trade-distortive effects of China’s excess capacity. In addition, the United States has taken action under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to increase duties or impose import quotas on steel and aluminum products after finding that excessive imports are a threat to U.S. national security. 100 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS",15,CHINA

Through intensive, high-level bilateral engagement with China since 2009, the United States has attempted to address these policies, which provide various preferences when IP",15,CHINA
Technology Transfer,"At the beginning of 2017, longstanding and serious U.S. concerns regarding technology transfer remained unaddressed, despite repeated, high-level bilateral commitments by China to remove or no longer pursue problematic policies and practices. At the same time, new concerns continued to emerge. In August 2017, the United States initiated a Section 301 investigation that focused on policies and practices of the Chinese Government related to technology transfer, IP, and innovation. Specifically, in its initiation notice, the United States identified four categories of reported Chinese Government conduct that would be the subject of its inquiry, including but not limited to: (1) the use of a variety of tools to require or pressure the transfer of technologies and IP to Chinese companies; (2) depriving U.S. companies of the ability to set market- based terms in technology licensing negotiations with Chinese companies; (3) intervention in markets by directing or unfairly facilitating the acquisition of U.S. companies and assets by Chinese companies to obtain cutting-edge technologies and IP; and, (4) conducting or supporting cyber-enabled theft and unauthorized intrusions into U.S. commercial computer networks for commercial gains. In March 2018, the United States issued a report supporting findings that the four categories of acts, policies, and practices covered in the investigation are unreasonable or discriminatory and burden and/or restrict U.S. commerce. In November 2018, the United States issued an updated report that found that China had FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 101 not taken any steps to change its problematic policies and practices. Based on the findings in the Section 301 investigation, the United States took a range of responsive actions, including the pursuit of a successful WTO case challenging certain discriminatory technology licensing measures maintained by China as well as the imposition of additional tariffs on Chinese imports. The Economic and Trade Agreement Between the United States of America and the People’s Republic of China (Phase One Agreement), addresses several of the unfair trade practices of China that were identified in the Section 301 Report. For the first time in any trade agreement, China agreed to end its longstanding practice of forcing or pressuring foreign companies to transfer their technology to Chinese companies as a condition for obtaining market access, securing administrative approvals, or receiving advantages from the Chinese Government. China also committed to provide transparency, fairness, and due process in administrative proceedings and to ensure that technology transfer and licensing take place on market terms. Separately, China committed to refrain from directing or supporting outbound investments aimed at acquiring foreign technology pursuant to its distortive industrial plans. Since the entry into force of the Phase One Agreement in February 2020, the United States has continually engaged with the U.S. business community, including on concerns about China’s informal, unwritten actions that force or pressure U.S. companies to transfer their technology to Chinese entities. The United States has engaged China as issues arise and will continue to monitor developments closely.",15,CHINA
Investment Restrictions,"China seeks to protect many domestic industries through a restrictive investment regime. Many aspects of China’s current investment regime continue to cause serious concerns for foreign investors. For example, China’s Foreign Investment Law and implementing regulations, both of which entered into force in January 2020, perpetuate separate regimes for domestic investors and investments and foreign investors and investments, and invite opportunities for discriminatory treatment. Liberalization of China’s investment regime has been insufficient, evidenced by the continued application of prohibitions, foreign equity caps, joint venture requirements, and other restrictions in certain sectors. China’s most recent version of its Foreign Investment Negative List, which entered into force in July 2020, leaves in place significant investment restrictions in a number of areas important to foreign investors, such as key services sectors, agriculture, certain extractive industries, and certain manufacturing industries. With regard to services sectors in particular, China maintains prohibitions or restrictions in key sectors such as cloud computing services, telecommunications services, film production and film distribution services, and video and entertainment software services. China’s Foreign Investment Law, implementing regulations, and other related measures suggest that China is pursuing the objective of replacing its case-by-case administrative approval system for a broad range of investments, with a system that would be applied only to “restricted” sectors. However, it remains unclear whether China is fully achieving that objective in practice. Moreover, even for sectors that have been liberalized, the potential for discriminatory licensing requirements or the discriminatory application of licensing processes could make it difficult to achieve meaningful market access. In addition, the establishment of a potentially overly broad national security review mechanism that lacks clear implementation guidelines, and the increasingly adverse impact of China’s Cybersecurity Law and related implementing measures, including ones that restrict cross-border data flows and impose data localization requirements, have serious negative implications for foreign investors and investments. Foreign companies also continue to report that Chinese Government officials may condition investment approval on a requirement that a foreign company transfer technology, conduct research and development (R&D) in China, satisfy performance requirements relating to exportation or the use of local content, or 102 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS",15,CHINA
Administrative Licensing,"U.S. companies continue to encounter significant problems with a variety of administrative licensing processes in China, including processes to secure product approvals, investment approvals, business expansion approvals, business license renewals, and even approvals for routine business activities. While there has been an overall reduction in license approval requirements and a focus on decentralizing licensing approval processes, U.S. companies report that these efforts have only had a marginal impact on their licensing experiences so far.",15,CHINA
Standards,"China continues to implement large-scale reforms to its standards system. These reforms seek to incorporate a “bottom up” strategy in standards development in addition to the existing “top down” system. In January 2018, China’s revised Standardization Law entered into force. Since then, China has issued numerous implementing measures, some of which contain positive references to the ability of foreign- invested enterprises to participate in China’s standardization activities and to the value of international standards. Many of these implementing measures cause concern for U.S. industry as they appear to focus on the development of Chinese standards without sufficient consideration being given to existing, internationally developed standards. In addition, they do not explicitly provide that foreign stakeholders may participate on equal terms with domestic competitors in all aspects of the standardization process, and they fall short of explicitly endorsing internationally accepted best practices. While China has been issuing these implementing measures, its existing technical committees have continued to develop standards. Foreign companies have reported an inconsistent ability to influence these domestic standards-setting processes, and even in technical committees where participation has been possible for some foreign stakeholders, it has typically been on terms less favorable than those applicable to their domestic competitors. For example, the technical committee for cybersecurity standards (known as TC-260) allows foreign companies to participate in standards development and setting, with several U.S. and other foreign companies being allowed to participate in some of the TC-260 working groups. However, foreign companies are not universally allowed to participate as voting members, and they report challenges to participating in key aspects of the standardization process, such as drafting. They also remain prohibited from participating in certain TC-260 working groups, such as the working group on encryption standards. Over the years, U.S. stakeholders have also reported that, in some cases, Chinese Government officials have pressured foreign companies seeking to participate in the standards-setting process to license their technology or intellectual property on unfavorable terms. In addition, China has continued to pursue unique national standards in a number of high technology areas where international standards already exist. The United States continues to press China to address these specific concerns, but this bilateral engagement has yielded minimal progress. FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 103 Notably, U.S. concerns about China’s standards regime are not limited to the implications for U.S. companies’ access to China’s market. China’s ongoing efforts to develop unique national standards aims eventually to serve the interests of Chinese companies seeking to compete globally, as the Chinese Government’s vision is to use the power of its large domestic market to promote or compel the adoption of Chinese standards in global markets. The United States has expressed, and will continue to express, concerns to China bilaterally and multilaterally as China continues to develop and issue implementing measures for its revised Standardization Law. In September 2020, the Standardization Administration of China (SAC) released its first Annual Report on China’s Standardization Development, which summarized China’s standardization activities in 2019. The report also described a planned initiative, China Standards 2035, which had not yet been published as of December 2020. This initiative is expected to become a key focus in the upcoming 14th Five-year Plan period. According to SAC, this initiative will focus on, among other things, the goal of making China a net recipient of licensing fees, as more and more of China’s standards are adopted as international standards and used in information and communications technology (ICT) products.",15,CHINA
Secure and Controllable ICT Policies,"In 2020, Chinese ministries continued to issue implementing measures for China’s Cybersecurity Law, a continued source of serious concern for U.S. companies since the law’s enactment in November 2016. Of particular concern are the Measures for Cybersecurity Review, issued in April 2020 and effective as of June 2020. This measure implements one element of the cybersecurity regime created by the Cybersecurity Law. Specifically, the measure puts in place a review process to regulate the purchase of ICT products and services by critical information infrastructure operators in China. The review process is to consider, among other things, potential national security risks related to interruption of service, data leakage, and reliability of supply chains. U.S. companies are concerned that measures like this one, which identifies supply chain reliability as a metric, may be used as justification for deciding not to procure U.S. products. As demonstrated in the implementing measures for the Cybersecurity Law, China’s approach is to impose severe restrictions on a wide range of U.S. and other foreign ICT products and services with an apparent goal of supporting China’s technology localization policies by encouraging the replacement of foreign ICT",15,CHINA
Encryption,"Use of ICT products and services is increasingly dependent on robust encryption, an essential functionality for protecting privacy and safeguarding sensitive commercial information. Onerous requirements on the use of encryption, including intrusive approval processes and, in many cases, mandatory use of indigenous encryption algorithms (e.g., for WiFi and 4G cellular products), continue to be cited by stakeholders as a significant trade barrier. In October 2019, China adopted a Cryptography Law that includes restrictive requirements for commercial encryption products that “involve national security, the national economy and people’s lives, and public interest,” which must undergo a security assessment. This broad definition of commercial encryption products that must undergo a security assessment raises concerns that the new Cryptography Law will lead to unnecessary restrictions on foreign ICT products and services. In August 2020, the State Cryptography Administration issued the draft Commercial Cryptography Administrative Regulations to implement the Cryptography Law. This draft measure did not address the concerns that the United States and numerous other stakeholders had raised regarding the Cryptography Law. The United States will continue to monitor implementation of the Cryptography Law and related measures. The United States will also remain vigilant about monitoring the introduction of any new requirements hindering technologically neutral use of robust, internationally standardized encryption.

Competition Policy,"In March 2018, as part of a major government reorganization, China announced the creation of the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), a new agency that now houses the former anti-monopoly enforcement authorities from the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM), and the State Administration of Industry and Commerce in one of its bureaus. It had been hoped that centralized anti-monopoly enforcement would lead to policy adjustments that address the serious concerns raised by the United States and other WTO Members in this area, but as of March 2021 it does not appear to have led to significant policy adjustments. As previously reported, China’s implementation of the Anti-monopoly Law poses multiple challenges. A",15,CHINA
Pharmaceuticals,"For several years, the United States has pressed China on a range of pharmaceuticals issues. These issues have related to matters such as overly restrictive patent application examination practices, regulatory approvals that are delayed or linked to extraneous criteria, weak protections against the unfair commercial use and unauthorized disclosure of regulatory data, and the need for an efficient mechanism to resolve patent infringement disputes. At the December 2014 JCCT meeting, China committed to significantly reduce time-to-market for innovative pharmaceutical products through streamlined processes and additional funding and personnel. Nevertheless, time-to-market for innovative pharmaceutical products in China remains a significant concern. Another serious ongoing concern stems from China’s proposals in the pharmaceuticals sector that seek to promote government-directed indigenous innovation and technology transfer through the provision of regulatory preferences. For example, in August 2015, a State Council measure issued in final form without public comment created an expedited regulatory approval process for innovative new drugs where the applicant’s manufacturing capacity had been shifted to China. The United States has urged China to reconsider this approach. In April 2016, China’s Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) issued a draft measure that effectively would require drug manufacturers to commit to price concessions as a pre-condition for securing marketing approval for new drugs. Given its inconsistency with international regulatory practices, which are based on safety, efficacy, and quality, the draft measure elicited serious concerns from the U.S. Government and industry. Subsequently, at the November 2016 JCCT meeting, China promised not to require any specific pricing information as part of the drug registration evaluation and approval process and, in addition, not to link pricing commitments to drug registration evaluation and approval. Given China’s lack of follow through in other areas, as discussed in this report, the United States remains concerned about whether these promises will be regularly fulfilled in practice. Accordingly, the United States remains in close contact with U.S. industry and has been examining developments carefully in this area. In April 2017, in response to sustained U.S. engagement, China issued amended patent examination guidelines that required patent examiners to take into account supplemental test data submitted during the patent examination process. However, as of March 2021, it appears that patent examiners in China have been either unduly restrictive or inconsistent in implementing the amended patent examination guidelines, resulting in rejections of supplemental data and denials of patents or invalidations of existing patents on medicines even when counterpart patents have been granted in other countries. CFDA also issued several draft notices in 2017 setting out a conceptual framework to protect against the unfair commercial use and unauthorized disclosure of undisclosed test or other data generated to obtain marketing approval for pharmaceutical products. In addition, this proposed framework sought to promote the efficient resolution of patent disputes between right holders and the producers of generic pharmaceuticals. However, in 2018, CFDA’s successor agency, the State Drug Administration (SDA), issued draft Drug Registration Regulations and implementing measures on drug trial data that would preclude or condition the duration of regulatory data protection on whether clinical trials and first marketing approval occur in China. Subsequently, in August 2019, China issued a revised Drug Administration Law, followed by revised Drug Registration Regulations in January 2020. Neither measure contained an effective mechanism for early resolution of potential patent disputes or any form of regulatory data protection. FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 107 As part of the Phase One Agreement, China agreed to establish a nationwide mechanism for the early resolution of potential pharmaceutical patent disputes that covers both small molecule drugs and biologics, including a cause of action to allow a patent holder to seek expeditious remedies before the marketing of an allegedly infringing product. The United States has been working closely with U.S. industry to monitor developments and to ensure that China’s new system works as contemplated. Separately, the Phase One Agreement also provides for patent term extensions to compensate for unreasonable patent and marketing approval delays that cut into the effective patent term as well as for the use of supplemental data to meet relevant patentability criteria for pharmaceutical patent applications. China has since amended the Patent Law with respect to patent term extensions, effective June 2021. The United States is closely monitoring China’s implementation of this commitment. The United States and China agreed to address data protection for pharmaceuticals in future negotiations.",15,CHINA
Medical Devices,"For many years, working closely with U.S. industry, the United States has been engaging China and raising concerns about its pricing and tendering procedures for medical devices and its discriminatory treatment of imported medical devices. At the November 2015 JCCT meeting, China did commit that, in terms of accessing the market, it will give imported medical devices the same treatment as medical devices manufactured or developed domestically. Unfortunately, China has not fulfilled this promise. In recent years, the United States has pressed China’s regulatory authorities to develop sound payment systems that adequately incentivize research and development in the medical device sector. China’s approach to volume-based procurement and its new national tendering process for stents suggests that China’s system may not sufficiently consider quality or clinical efficacy in these processes. Both processes do not account for differences in technological innovation or clinical outcomes, and may limit access to China’s market for U.S. companies. Additionally, the medical devices sector has been identified by the Chinese Government as a priority strategic sector for domestic development under the Made in China 2025 industrial plan. The United States will continue to urge China to provide imported medical devices with fair and equal access to China’s market.",15,CHINA
Cosmetics,"Over the past several years, the United States and U.S. industry have engaged with CFDA and its successor, the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA), to highlight concerns with China’s regulation of cosmetics. As of March 2021, U.S. concerns generally have not been addressed, either in the Cosmetics Supervision and Administration Regulation (CSAR) that China issued in final form in June 2020 or in various draft CSAR implementing measures issued for public comment. Instead, China has gone forward with finalizing and adopting CSAR implementing measures largely without addressing U.S. concerns. Since June 2020, China has issued about a dozen draft measures to implement the new CSAR regulatory structure for public comment, nine of which China also has notified to the WTO TBT Committee. While the language in the CSAR suggests that China is seeking to modernize its regulation of cosmetics and reduce the time required for product and ingredient registration and approval, the draft implementing measures contain provisions that would require the disclosure of much more information than was previously needed to manage product safety in China’s cosmetic marketplace. The United States has expressed concern to China that Chinese regulators are applying the same approach to general and special cosmetics as is used with drugs and medical devices, which present much higher risks. China is introducing new requirements, which do not align with the filing and registration requirements for cosmetics in other major markets and will be very burdensome for importers. 108 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS",15,CHINA
Export Restraints,"China continues to deploy a combination of export restraints, including export quotas, export licensing, minimum export prices, export duties, and other restrictions, on a number of raw material inputs where it holds the leverage of being among the world’s leading producers. Through these export restraints, it appears that China is able to provide substantial economic advantages to a wide range of downstream producers in China at the expense of foreign downstream producers, while creating pressure on foreign downstream producers to move their operations, technologies, and jobs to China. FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 109 In 2013, China removed its export quotas and duties on several raw material inputs of key interest to the U.S. steel, aluminum, and chemicals industries after the United States won a dispute settlement case against China at the WTO. In 2014, the United States won a second WTO case, focusing on China’s export restraints on rare earths, tungsten, and molybdenum, which are key inputs for a multitude of U.S.-made products, including hybrid automotive batteries, wind turbines, energy-efficient lighting, steel, advanced electronics, automobiles, petroleum, and chemicals. China removed those export restraints in 2015. In 2016, the United States launched a third WTO case challenging export restraints maintained by China. The challenged export restraints include export quotas and export duties maintained by China on various forms of 11 raw materials, including antimony, chromium, cobalt, copper, graphite, indium, lead, magnesia, talc, tantalum, and tin. These raw materials are key inputs in important U.S. manufacturing industries, including aerospace, automotive, construction, and electronics. While China appears to have removed the challenged export restraints, the United States continues to monitor the situation. In the United States’ view, it is deeply concerning that the United States was forced to bring multiple cases to address the same obvious WTO compliance issues. A responsible WTO Member would have withdrawn its highly trade-distortive export restraint policies after the first definitive WTO litigation.",15,CHINA
Value-added Tax Rebates and Related Policies,"As in prior years, in 2020, the Chinese Government attempted to manage the export of many primary, intermediate, and downstream products by raising or lowering the value-added tax (VAT) rebate available upon export. China sometimes reinforces its objectives by imposing or retracting export duties. These practices have caused tremendous disruption, uncertainty, and unfairness in the global markets for some products, particularly downstream products where China is a leading world producer or exporter, such as products made by the steel, aluminum, and soda ash industries. These practices, together with other policies, such as excessive government subsidization, have also contributed to severe excess capacity in these same industries. An apparently positive development took place at the July 2014 S&ED meeting, when China committed to improve its VAT rebate system, including by actively studying international best practices, and to deepen communication with the United States on this matter, including regarding its impact on trade. This promise too, however, remains unfulfilled. As of March 2021, China has not made any movement toward the adoption of international best practices.",15,CHINA
Import Ban on Remanufactured Products,"China prohibits the importation of remanufactured products, which it typically classifies as used goods. China also maintains restrictions that prevent remanufacturing process inputs (known as cores) from being imported into China’s customs territory, except special economic zones. These import prohibitions and restrictions undermine the development of industries in many sectors in China, including mining, agriculture, healthcare, transportation, and communications, because companies in these industries are unable to purchase high-quality, lower-cost remanufactured products produced outside of China.",15,CHINA
Import Ban on Recyclable Materials,"Since 2017, China has issued numerous measures that limit or ban imports of most scrap and recovered materials, such as certain types of plastic, paper, and metals. China has also employed import licensing and inspection measures in order to restrict imports of these materials that appear to not be aligned with international standards. Notably, it appears that China does not apply similar restrictions to domestically sourced scrap and recovered materials. 110 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS",15,CHINA
Trade Remedies,"As of March 2021, China had in place 111 antidumping (AD) measures, affecting imports from 16 countries or regions. China also had in place six countervailing duties (CVD) measures, affecting imports from four countries or regions. In addition, China had seven AD and four CVD investigations in progress. The greatest systemic shortcomings in China’s AD and CVD practice continue to be in the areas of transparency and procedural fairness, and in recent years China had invoked AD and CVD remedies under troubling circumstances. In response, the United States has pressed China bilaterally, in WTO meetings and through written comments submitted in connection with pending AD and CVD proceedings, to adhere strictly to WTO rules in the conduct of its trade remedy investigations. The United States has also consistently pursued WTO dispute settlement where necessary. In practice, it appears that China’s conduct of AD investigations continues to fall short of full commitment to the fundamental tenets of transparency and procedural fairness embodied in the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement. In 2020, the United States and other WTO members continued to express concerns about key lapses in transparency and procedural fairness in China’s conduct of AD investigations. The principal areas of concern include MOFCOM’s inadequate disclosure of key documents placed on the record by domestic Chinese producers; insufficient disclosures of the essential facts underlying MOFCOM decisions, such as dumping margin calculations and evidence supporting injury and dumping conclusions; MOFCOM’s failure to issue supplemental questionnaires in instances where MOFCOM seeks additional information from U.S. respondents; the improper rejection of U.S. respondents’ reported cost and sales data; the unjustified use of facts available; and MOFCOM’s failure to adequately address critical arguments or evidence put forward by interested parties. These aspects of China’s AD practices have been raised with MOFCOM in numerous proceedings. Some of them have also been challenged by the United States in WTO cases involving grain oriented flat-rolled electrical steel (GOES), chicken broiler products, and automobiles. In each of the WTO cases, the WTO has upheld U.S. claims relating to transparency and procedural fairness. FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 111 A review of China’s conduct of CVD investigations makes clear that, as in the AD area, China needs to improve its transparency and procedural fairness when conducting these investigations. In addition, the United States has noted procedural concerns specific to China’s conduct of CVD investigations. For example, China initiated investigations of alleged subsidies that raised concerns, given the requirements regarding “sufficient evidence” in Article 11.2 of the SCM Agreement. The United States is also concerned about China’s application of facts available under Article 12.7 of the SCM Agreement. Notably, the United States has expressed serious concerns about China’s pursuit of AD and CVD remedies that appear intended to discourage the United States and other trading partners from the legitimate exercise of their rights under WTO AD and CVD rules and the trade remedy provisions of China’s accession agreement. China’s regulatory authorities in some instances seem to be pursuing AD and CVD",15,CHINA

Corporate Social Credit System,"Since 2014, China has been working to implement a national “social credit” system for both individuals and companies by 2020. The implementation of this system through a new information collection network is at a more advanced stage for companies versus individuals, as “unified social credit codes” have been assigned to every domestic and foreign company in China. These 18-digit codes provide a way for the Chinese Government to match a company with its record of administrative compliance across a range of regulatory and enforcement bodies. Previously disparate information relating to a company’s financial records, regulatory compliance, inspection results and other administrative enforcement activities have now been consolidated under a company’s unified social credit code. All of this data is stored in the National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System (NECIPS). In addition to information gathered through government inspections, reviews and related activities, companies themselves transfer data to the NECIPS as mandated by various reporting processes, including information relating to investments and business operations. If the data collected on a company includes negative ratings, including being placed on a government agency’s blacklist, the company’s social credit score will be downgraded. Negative ratings or placement on a government agency’s blacklist can lead to various restrictions on a company’s business activities. A company could face increased inspections, reduced access to loans and tax incentives, restrictions on government procurement, reduced land-use rights, monetary fines or permit denials, among other possible penalties. The social credit system has been tied to larger policy objectives as well. For example, in November 2018, NDRC and China’s National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA), together with 36 other Party and government entities, jointly signed the Memorandum of Cooperation on Joint Punishment of Seriously Dishonest Entities in the Field of Intellectual Property Rights (Patents). This measure and related measures seek to strengthen China’s intellectual property protection by linking enforcement with the social credit system. Currently, there is no fully integrated national system for assigning comprehensive social credit scores for companies. Instead, certain Chinese Government agencies, such as CNIPA, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), and the General Administration of Customs, among several others, maintain their own FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 113 rating systems at central and local levels of government and make their own decisions about the types of transgressions that warrant negative ratings or placing a company on a blacklist. As of March 2021, it appears that most of these systems are being used to promote regulatory compliance. In a broad effort focused on rating financial creditworthiness, NDRC announced in September 2019 that 33 million companies had been included in the first batch of comprehensive public credit appraisals. These companies were assigned one of four grades––excellent, good, fair or poor––depending on their creditworthiness and whether they appeared on any government agency blacklists. NDRC has indicated that all companies operating in China will eventually be subject to comprehensive public credit appraisals and will receive differing levels of regulatory scrutiny depending on their grades. With a few exceptions, the comprehensive scores are not made public, and the formula used to calculate the rankings are unknown. In July 2020, NDRC and PBOC jointly issued the draft Guiding Opinions for Further Standardizing the Input Scope of Public Credit Information, Penalty for Bad Credit, and Credit Repairs in Building a Long- Term Mechanism for Credit Regime Construction, which again called on government agencies to standardize procedures for evaluating credit violations and for sharing credit information sharing between government agencies to better implement joint punishments. It appears that SAMR, which manages the NECIPS, is closely involved with coordinating these disparate systems, although NDRC retains the lead for coordinating Chinese data standardization nationally. The goal is for NECIPS to serve as a single, national platform for sharing corporate social credit information throughout the Chinese Government and to enable relevant agencies to pursue joint punishment for repeat or egregious offenders. For example, in July 2019, SAMR issued the draft Measures for Administration of the List of Serious Violators of Trust and Law for public comment. In this draft measure, SAMR outlines a series of circumstances that would warrant a company being included in SAMR’s centrally managed blacklist, which the draft measure refers to as a list of companies that have committed “serious violations of law and trust.” It appears that this blacklist would include companies that have committed the types of violations that currently warrant inclusion on individual agencies’ blacklists as well as other types of violations of law or trust. The blacklist would set forth the name of the company and the reasons for its inclusion and would be publicly available through the NECIPS website. In the draft measure, SAMR also calls for agencies to share the underlying information that led to a company’s blacklisting with each other and with industry associations in order to facilitate joint punishment of blacklisted companies. Foreign companies are concerned that the corporate social credit system will also be used by the Chinese Government to pressure them to act in accordance with relevant Chinese industrial policies or otherwise to make investments or conduct their business operations in ways that run counter to market principles or their own business strategies. Foreign companies are also concerned about the opaque nature of the corporate social credit system. Currently, for example, a company sometimes only learns about its negative ratings when it requests a permit and receives a denial, even though the Measures for Administration of the List of Serious Violators of Trust and Law includes a requirement that companies be informed of their blacklisting in advance. Other times, a company learns for the first time that it has been blacklisted when a Chinese Government agency posts its name on the agency’s website, even though the blacklisting of a company can cause severe harm to the company’s reputation and adversely impact its efforts to attract customers, secure needed financing or make new investments. When Chinese Government agencies begin to pursue joint punishment in the way that NDRC envisions, it also may mean that an infraction in one regulatory context could have wider consequences across the company’s business operations. Another key concern regarding the corporate social credit system involves its links to the individual social credit system. In this regard, in addition to its own corporate behavior, a company may be required to monitor key personnel to ensure that their individual social credit scores do not decline because of negative ratings and adversely impact the company’s corporate social credit score. Given the similarly opaque nature of the individual social credit system and its goal of comprehensively regulating an individual’s behavior, 114 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS",15,CHINA

Particularly troubling are reports that actors affiliated with the Chinese Government and the Chinese military have infiltrated the computer systems of U.S. companies, stealing terabytes of data, including the companies’ proprietary information and IP, for the purpose of providing commercial advantages to Chinese enterprises. In high-level bilateral dialogues with the United States over the years, China had committed to issue judicial guidance to strengthen its trade secrets regime. China had also committed not to condone state-sponsored misappropriation of trade secrets for commercial use. In addition, the United States had urged China to make certain key amendments to its trade secrets-related laws and regulations, particularly with regard to a draft revision of the Anti-unfair Competition Law. The United States had also urged China to take actions to address inadequacies across the range of state-sponsored actors and to promote public awareness of trade secrets disciplines. At the November 2016 JCCT meeting, China claimed that it was strengthening its trade secrets regime and bolstering several areas of importance, including the availability of evidence preservation orders and damages based on market value as well as the issuance of a judicial interpretation on preliminary injunctions and other matters. In 2016 and 2017, China circulated proposed revisions to the Anti-unfair Competition Law for public comment. China issued the corresponding final measure in November 2017, effective January 2018. Despite improvements in the protection of trade secrets relative to prior law, the final measure reflects a number of missed opportunities for the promotion of effective trade secrets protection. Although China further amended its Anti-unfair Competition Law and its Administrative Licensing Law in April 2019, these amendments still do not fully address critical shortcomings in the scope of protections and obstacles to enforcement. The Phase One Agreement significantly strengthens protections for trade secrets and enforcement against trade secret theft in China. In particular, the IP Chapter requires China: to expand the scope of civil liability for misappropriation beyond entities directly involved in the manufacture or sale of goods and services; to cover acts such as electronic intrusions as prohibited acts of trade secret theft; to shift the burden of proof in civil cases to the defendants when there is a reasonable indication of trade secret theft; to make it easier to obtain preliminary injunctions to prevent the use of stolen trade secrets; to allow for initiation of criminal investigations without the need to show actual losses; to ensure that criminal enforcement is available for willful trade secret misappropriation; and to prohibit government personnel and third party experts and advisors from engaging in the unauthorized disclosure of undisclosed information, trade secrets, and confidential business information submitted to the Chinese Government. In 2020, China published draft measures relating to civil, criminal and administrative enforcement of trade secrets, such as SAMR’s draft Provisions on the Protection of Trade Secrets. In September 2020, the Supreme People’s Court issued the Provisions on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Law in Civil Cases of Trade Secret Infringement and the Interpretation III on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Law in Handling Criminal Cases of Infringement of Intellectual Property Rights. In September 2020, the Supreme People’s Procuratorate and the Ministry of Public Security also issued the Decision on Amendment of Docketing for Prosecution of Criminal Trade Secrets Infringement Cases Standards. These measures relate to issues such as the scope of liability for trade secret misappropriation, prohibited acts of trade secret theft, preliminary injunctions and thresholds for initiations of criminal investigations for trade secret theft. The United States will continue to monitor the effectiveness of these measures.",15,CHINA
Bad Faith Trademark Registration,"The continuing registration of trademarks in bad faith in China remains a significant concern. At the November 2016 JCCT meeting, China publicly noted the harm that can be caused by bad faith trademarks 116 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS",15,CHINA
Online Infringement,"Online piracy continues on a large scale in China, affecting a wide range of industries, including those involved in distributing legitimate music, motion pictures, books and journals, software, and video games. While increased enforcement activities have helped stem the flow of online sales of some pirated offerings, much more sustained action and attention is needed to make a meaningful difference for content creators and rights holders, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple reports indicate that a large number of infringers have moved online to distribute their pirated and counterfeit goods, which further increases the need for targeted and sustained enforcement measures in the online environment. In recent years, the United States has urged China to consider ways to create a broader policy environment that helps foster the growth of healthy markets for licensed and legitimate content. The United States has also urged China to revise existing rules that have proven to be counterproductive. At the November 2016 JCCT meeting, China agreed to actively promote electronic commerce-related legislation, strengthen supervision over online infringement and counterfeiting, and to work with the United States to explore the use of new approaches to enhance online enforcement capacity. In December 2016 and November 2017, China published drafts of a new E-Commerce Law for public comment. In written comments, the United States stressed that the final version of this law should not undermine the existing notice-and-takedown regime and should promote effective cooperation in deterring online infringement. In August 2018, China adopted its new E-Commerce Law, which entered into force in January 2019. This law was an opportunity for China to institute strong provisions on IP protection and enforcement for its e- commerce market, which is now the largest in the world. However, as finalized, the law instead introduced provisions that weaken the ability of rights holders to protect their rights online and that alleviate the liability of Chinese electronic commerce platforms for selling counterfeit and other infringing goods. A",15,CHINA
Counterfeit Goods,"Counterfeiting in China remains widespread and affects a wide range of goods. In April 2019, China amended its Trademark Law, effective November 2019, to require civil courts to order the destruction of counterfeit goods, but these amendments still do not provide the full scope of civil remedies for right holders. One of many areas of particular U.S. concern involves medications. Despite years of sustained engagement by the United States, China still needs to improve its regulation of the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients to prevent their use in counterfeit and substandard medications. At the July 2014 S&ED meeting, China committed to develop and seriously consider amendments to the Drug Administration Law that will require regulatory control of the manufacturers of bulk chemicals that can be used as active pharmaceutical ingredients. At the June 2015 S&ED meeting, China further committed to publish revisions to the Drug Administration Law in draft form for public comment and to take into account the views of the United States and other relevant stakeholders. In October 2017, China published limited draft revisions to the Drug Administration Law and stated that future proposed revisions to the remainder of this law would be forthcoming. Although the final Drug Administration Law, issued in August 2019, requires pharmaceuticals products and active pharmaceutical ingredients to meet manufacturing standards, it is unclear how these requirements will be implemented or enforced. The Phase One Agreement requires China to take effective enforcement action against counterfeit pharmaceuticals and related products, including active pharmaceutical ingredients, and to significantly increase actions to stop the manufacture and distribution of counterfeits with significant health or safety risks. The Phase One Agreement also requires China to provide that its judicial authorities shall order the forfeiture and destruction of pirated and counterfeit goods, along with the materials and implements predominantly used in their manufacture. In addition, the Agreement requires China to significantly increase the number of enforcement actions at physical markets in China and against goods that are exported or in transit. It further requires China to ensure, through third party audits, that government agencies and SOEs only use licensed software. In August 2020, SAMR issued the Opinions on Strengthening the Destruction of Infringing and Counterfeit Goods, and the State Council amended the Provisions on the Transfer of Suspected Criminal Cases by Administrative Organs for Law Enforcement, which relate to the transfer of IP cases from administrative authorities to criminal authorities. During that same month, the Office of the National Leading Group on the Fight against IPR Infringement and Counterfeiting, , together with several other Party and government entities, jointly issued the Opinions on Strengthening the Destruction of Infringing and Counterfeit Goods, which contained detailed provisions regarding the processes for destroying infringing materials, including the scope of materials to be destroyed (e.g., the goods, labels, certificate, and packaging materials), timelines for destruction (e.g., generally six months), as well as categorization, supervision, and pollution control, among other issues. In September 2020, the Supreme People’s Court (SPC) issued the Opinions on Legally Imposing Heavier Punishments for Infringements of Intellectual Property Rights, which called for quick destruction of goods and stressed that, for goods which cannot be destroyed, the courts must dispose of them outside of commercial channels but in such a way that reduces the risk of further infringement as much as possible. In addition, in November 2020, the SPC also issued the Opinions on Strengthening the Protection of Copyright and Copyright-Related Rights, which contained provisions addressing requests by rights holders for immediate destruction of infringing goods in civil proceedings and the ex officio destruction of pirated goods in criminal copyright proceedings. China has reported increased enforcement actions against counterfeit medicines and increased customs actions against pirated and counterfeit goods. Nevertheless, China also needs to show that it had increased enforcement actions against counterfeits with health and safety risks and at physical markets, increased training of customs personnel and ensured the use of only licensed software in government agencies and SOEs. 118 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS",15,CHINA
AGRICULTURE,Overview,15,CHINA
Overview,"China remains a difficult and unpredictable market for U.S. agricultural exporters, largely because of inconsistent enforcement of regulations and selective intervention in the market by China’s regulatory authorities. The failure of China’s regulators to routinely follow science-based, international standards, and guidelines further complicates and impedes agricultural trade. The Phase One Agreement addresses structural barriers to trade and aims to support a dramatic expansion of U.S. food, agriculture, and seafood product exports, which will increase U.S. farm and fishery income, generate more rural economic activity, and promote job growth. The Phase One Agreement addresses a multitude of non-tariff barriers to U.S. agriculture and seafood products, including for meat and meat products, poultry, seafood, rice, dairy, infant formula, horticultural products, animal feed and feed additives, pet food, and products of agricultural biotechnology. The Agreement also includes enforceable commitments requiring China to purchase and import on average at least $40 billion of U.S. agricultural and seafood products per year in 2021 and 2022, representing an average annual increase of at least $16 billion over 2017 levels. China also agreed that it will strive to purchase and import an additional $5 billion of U.S. agricultural and seafood products each year.",15,CHINA
Agricultural Domestic Support,"For several years, China had been significantly increasing domestic subsidies and other support measures for its agricultural sector. China maintains direct payment programs, minimum support prices for basic commodities, and input subsidies. China has implemented a cotton reserve system, based on minimum purchase prices, and cotton target price programs. In 2016, China established subsidies for starch and ethanol producers to incentivize the purchase of domestic corn, resulting in higher volumes of exports of processed corn products from China in 2017 and 2018. China submitted a notification concerning domestic support measures to the WTO in May 2015, but it only provided information up to 2010. In December 2018, China notified domestic support measures for the period 2011–2016. This notification showed that China had exceeded its level of domestic",15,CHINA

Agricultural Biotechnology Approvals,"The Chinese regulatory approval process for agricultural biotechnology products creates significant uncertainty among developers and traders, slowing commercialization of products and creating adverse trade impacts, particularly for U.S. exports of corn, soy, and alfalfa. Meanwhile, the number of products pending Chinese regulatory approval continues to increase. In addition, the asynchrony between China’s biotechnology product approvals and the product approvals made by other countries has widened considerably in recent years. In the past, biotechnology product approvals by China’s regulatory authorities mainly materialized only after high-level political intervention. For example, following a meeting between the presidents of the United States and China in April 2017, China’s National Biosafety Committee (NBC) met in May and June 2017 and issued two product approvals after each meeting, while taking no action on several other products that were subject to NBC review. Following another the meeting between the two presidents in Buenos Aires in December 2018, the NBC issued five additional product approvals and 23 renewals. One year later, in December 2019, the NBC issued two additional product approvals and 10 renewals. More recently, in June 2020, the NBC issued six additional product approvals and one renewal, and in December 2020 it issued two additional product approvals and three renewals. Unfortunately, as of March 2021, the NBC still has not approved one canola event and two alfalfa events whose applications have been pending for more than eight years. In addition, while the NBC is required to meet at least two times each year, the meetings are not held pursuant to a regular schedule, and information about the meetings is not widely shared with the public. 120 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS",15,CHINA
Food Safety Law,"China’s ongoing implementation of its 2015 Food Safety Law has led to the introduction of a myriad of new measures. These measures include exporter facility and product registration requirements for goods such as dairy, infant formula, seafood, grains, animal feed, pet food, and oilseeds. Overall, China’s notification of these measures to the WTO TBT Committee and the WTO Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (WTO SPS Committee) has been uneven. Despite facing strong international opposition and agreeing to a two-year implementation delay of an official certification requirement for all food products, China’s regulatory authorities issued a draft measure for public comment in November 2019 that would require the registration of all foreign food manufacturers. The draft measure could be even more burdensome than the previous requirement, which mandated official certification of all food products, including low-risk food exports. The United States submitted comprehensive written comments on the draft measure and also urged China to notify the draft measure to the WTO TBT Committee and the WTO SPS Committee. This draft measure and similar prior measures continue to place excessive strain on traders and exporting countries’ regulatory authorities, with no apparent added benefit to food safety. Instead, these measures seemingly provide China with a tool to control the volume of food imports as decided by China’s state planners. In November 2020, China’s regulatory authorities issued a further revision of the November 2019 draft measure. In January 2021, the United States submitted written comments on the draft measure in an effort to ensure that the final version of this measure is based on science and risk. The Phase One Agreement addresses many SPS and food safety issues. China also specifically committed that it would not implement food safety regulations that are not science- or risk-based and that it would only apply food safety regulations to the extent necessary to protect human life or health.",15,CHINA
Poultry,"In January 2015, due to an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in the United States, China imposed a ban on the import of all U.S. poultry products. Even though the outbreak was resolved in 2017 in accordance with the guidelines of the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), China did not take any action to re-open its market to U.S. poultry products until November 2019. At that time, China reopened its market to U.S. poultry meat, but not to other U.S. poultry products such as shell eggs. Since then, China’s General Administration of Customs had completed the updating of a list of hundreds of U.S. establishments eligible to export poultry meat to China. In the Phase One Agreement, China agreed to maintain measures consistent with OIE guidelines for future outbreaks of avian influenza. China also agreed to sign and implement a regionalization protocol within 30 days of entry into force of the agreement, which it did, to help avoid unwarranted nationwide animal FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 121 disease restrictions in the future. Subsequently, during an avian influenza outbreak in South Carolina in April 2020, China did not restrict imports of poultry products from other U.S. regions.",15,CHINA
Beef,"In May 2017, China committed to allow the resumption of U.S. beef shipments into its market consistent with international food safety and animal health standards. However, China back-tracked one month later and insisted that it would retain certain conditions relating to veterinary drugs, growth promotants, and animal health that appear to be inconsistent with international food safety and animal health standards. For example, China insisted on maintaining a zero-tolerance ban on the use of beta-agonists and synthetic hormones commonly used by global cattle producers under strict veterinary controls and following Codex Alimentarius (Codex) guidelines. Beef from only about three percent of U.S. cattle qualified for importation into China under these conditions. In the Phase One Agreement, China agreed to expand the scope of U.S. beef products allowed to be imported, to eliminate age restrictions on cattle slaughtered for export to China, and to recognize the U.S. beef and beef products’ traceability system. China also agreed to establish MRLs for three synthetic hormones legally used for decades in the United States consistent with Codex standards and guidelines. Where Codex standards and guidelines do not yet exist, China agreed to use MRLs established by other countries that have performed science-based risk assessments.",15,CHINA
Pork,"China maintains an approach to U.S. pork that appears inconsistent with international standards, limiting the potential of an important export market given China’s growing meat consumption and major shortages of domestic pork due to African swine fever.

In the past, China randomly enforced a zero tolerance for the detection of in imported pork. In",15,CHINA
Horticultural Products,"For years, China had not approved longstanding market access requests for a variety of U.S. horticultural products, despite having received sufficient technical and scientific data justifying market access. Affected products include potatoes, nectarines, blueberries, and avocados. In the Phase One Agreement, China agreed to sign and implement new phytosanitary protocols to allow imports of fresh potatoes for processing, blueberries, California nectarines, and California avocados from the United States. China also agreed to allow imports of barley, alfalfa pellets and cubes, almond meal pellets and cubes, and timothy hay from the United States. 122 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS",15,CHINA
Value-added Tax Rebates and Related Policies,"The Chinese Government attempted to manage imports of primary agricultural commodities by raising or lowering the VAT rebate to manage domestic supplies.

Overview,"Prospects for U.S. service suppliers in China should be promising, given the size of China’s market. Nevertheless, while the United States exported $56.5 billion in services to China and maintained a $36.4 billion surplus in trade in services with China in 2019 (latest data available), the U.S. share of China’s services market remained well below the U.S. share of the global services market, and over half of U.S. services exports by value were in education, personal travel, and other forms of travel by Chinese citizens to the United States, rather sales of services within China itself. In 2020, numerous challenges persisted in a number of services sectors. As in past years, Chinese regulators continued to use discriminatory regulatory processes, informal bans on entry and expansion, case-by-case approvals in some services sectors, overly burdensome licensing and operating requirements, and other means to frustrate the efforts of U.S. suppliers of services to achieve their full market potential in China. These policies and practices affect U.S. service suppliers across a wide range of sectors, including express delivery, cloud computing, telecommunications, film production and distribution, online video and entertainment software, and legal services. In addition, China’s Cybersecurity Law and related draft and final implementing measures include mandates to purchase domestic ICT products and services, restrictions on cross-border data flows, and requirements to store and process data locally. China’s draft Personal Information Protection Law also includes restrictions on cross-border data flows and requirements to store and process data locally. These types of data restrictions undermine U.S. services suppliers’ ability to take advantage of market access opportunities in China. China also had failed to fully address U.S. concerns in areas that have been the subject of WTO dispute settlement, including electronic payment services and theatrical film importation and distribution. The Phase One Agreement addresses a number of longstanding trade and investment barriers to U.S. providers of a wide range of financial services, including banking, insurance, securities, asset management, credit rating, and electronic payment services, among others. The barriers addressed in that Agreement include joint venture requirements, foreign equity limitations, and various discriminatory regulatory requirements. Removal of these barriers should allow U.S. financial service providers to compete on a more level playing field and expand their services export offerings in the China market.",15,CHINA
Banking Services,"Although China had opened its banking sector to foreign competition in the form of wholly foreign-owned banks, China has maintained restrictions on market access in other ways that have kept foreign banks from establishing, expanding, and obtaining significant market share in China. Recently, China had taken some steps to ease or remove market access restrictions, but those steps have not yet strongly manifested themselves in terms of increased market share, as foreign banks have held only 1.4 percent of banking assets in China in 2020. FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 123 During the past three years, China had removed a number of long-standing barriers for foreign banks, including the $10 billion minimum asset requirement for establishing a foreign bank in China and the $20 billion minimum asset requirement for setting up a Chinese branch of a foreign bank. China had also removed the cap on the equity interest that a single foreign investor can hold in a Chinese-owned bank, although it is not yet clear whether, in practice, China will allow any interested foreign banks to take advantage of this opening. At the same time, discriminatory and non-transparent regulations have limited foreign banks’ ability to participate in China’s market, particularly in providing capital market-related activities. In the Phase One Agreement, China committed to remove some of these barriers and to expand opportunities for U.S. financial institutions, including bank branches, to supply securities investment fund custody services by taking into account their global assets when they seek licenses. China also agreed to review and approve qualified applications by U.S. financial institutions for securities investment fund custody licenses on an expeditious basis. In addition, China committed to take into account the international qualifications of U.S. financial institutions when evaluating license applications for Type-A lead underwriting services for all types of non-financial debt instruments in China.",15,CHINA

It also committed to ensure that U.S. suppliers of securities, asset management, and futures services are able to access China’s market on a non-discriminatory basis, including with regard to the review and approval of license applications.",15,CHINA
Insurance Services,"In the Phase One Agreement, China committed to remove accelerate the removal of the foreign equity caps for life, pension, and health insurance no later than April 1, 2020. In addition, it confirmed the removal of the 30-year operating requirement, known as a “seasoning” requirement, which had been applied to foreign insurers seeking to establish operations in China in all insurance sectors. China also committed to remove all other discriminatory regulatory requirements and processes and to expeditiously review and approve license applications. Consistent with China’s commitments in the Phase One Agreement, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) announced that China would allow wholly foreign-owned companies for the life, pension, and health insurance sectors as of January 1, 2020. Prior to this announcement, China had maintained foreign equity caps and only permitted foreign companies to establish as Chinese-foreign joint ventures in these sectors. China allows wholly foreign-owned companies in the non-life (i.e., property and casualty) insurance sector. However, the market share of foreign-invested companies in this sector is only about two percent. In other insurance sectors, the United States continues to encourage China to establish more transparent procedures so as to better enable foreign participation in China’s market. Sectors in need of more transparency include export credit insurance and political risk insurance. Finally, some U.S. insurance companies established in China have encountered difficulties in getting the CBIRC to issue timely approvals of their requests to open up new internal branches to expand their 124 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS",15,CHINA
Electronic Payment Services,"In a WTO case launched in 2010, the United States challenged China’s restrictions on foreign companies, including major U.S. credit and debit card processing companies, which had been seeking to supply electronic payment services to banks and other businesses that issue or accept credit and debit cards in China. The United States argued that China had committed in its WTO accession agreement to open up this sector in 2006, and a WTO panel agreed with the United States in a decision issued in 2012. China subsequently agreed to comply with the WTO panel’s rulings in 2013, but did not take needed steps even to allow foreign suppliers to apply for licenses until June 2017, when China’s regulator––the People’s Bank of China (PBOC)––finalized the establishment of a two-step licensing process in which a supplier must first complete one year of preparatory work before even being able to apply for an actual license. By the time that the United States and China entered into the Phase One Agreement in January 2020, no foreign supplier of electronic payment services had yet been able to secure the license needed to operate in China’s market due largely to delays caused by PBOC. Indeed, at times, PBOC refused even to accept applications to begin preparatory work from U.S. suppliers, the first of two required steps in the licensing process. Meanwhile, as China actively delayed opening up its market to foreign suppliers, the leading Chinese company, China Union Pay, used its exclusive access to domestic currency transactions in the China market, and the revenues that come with it, to support its efforts to build out its electronic payment services network abroad, including in the United States. This history shows how China has been able to maintain market-distorting practices that benefit its own companies, even in the face of adverse rulings at the WTO. In the Phase One Agreement, China committed to ensure that PBOC operates an improved and timely licensing process for U.S. suppliers of electronic payment services so as to facilitate their access to China’s market. In June 2020, four months after the entry into force of the Phase One Agreement, one U.S. supplier became the first foreign supplier of electronic payment services to secure a license to operate in China’s market. Meanwhile, the United States is closely monitoring developments as applications from two other U.S. suppliers are progressing through PBOC’s licensing process. The United States will continue to closely monitor PBOC’s licensing process going forward to ensure China’s compliance with its commitments in the Phase One Agreement.",15,CHINA

According to a U.S. industry report, of more than 200 licenses issued as of June 2014, only two had been issued to foreign-invested suppliers, and those two were for very limited services. This report provides clear evidence supporting stakeholder concerns about the difficulties they have faced entering the market and the slow process foreign firms face in getting licensed.

Telecommunications Services,"China’s restrictions on basic telecommunications services, such as informal bans on new entry, a 49 percent foreign equity cap, a requirement that foreign suppliers can only enter into joint ventures with SOEs, and exceedingly high capital requirements, have long blocked foreign suppliers from accessing China’s basic telecommunications services market. Since China acceded to the WTO almost two decades ago, not a single foreign firm has succeeded in establishing a new joint venture to enter this sector. Restrictions maintained by China on less highly regulated value-added telecommunications services also have created serious barriers to market entry for foreign suppliers seeking to enter this sector. These restrictions include opaque and arbitrary licensing procedures, foreign equity caps, and periodic, unjustified moratoria on the issuance of new licenses. As a result, only a few dozen foreign-invested suppliers have secured licenses to provide certain value-added telecommunications services, while there are thousands of licensed domestic suppliers, and the range of licenses available to foreign suppliers is significantly less than those available to domestic suppliers.",15,CHINA
Internet Regulatory Regime,"China’s Internet regulatory regime is restrictive and non-transparent, affecting a broad range of commercial services activities conducted via the Internet, and is overseen by multiple agencies without clear lines of jurisdiction. China’s Internet economy had boomed over the past decade and is second in size only to that of the United States. Growth in China has been marked in service sectors similar to those found in the United States, including retail websites, search engines, online education, travel, advertising, audio-visual and computer gaming services, electronic mail and text, online job searches, Internet consulting, mapping services, applications, web domain registration, and electronic trading. However, in the Chinese market, Chinese companies dominate due in large part to restrictions imposed on foreign companies by the Chinese Government. At the same time, foreign companies continue to encounter major difficulties in attempting to offer these and other Internet-based services on a cross-border basis. China continues to engage in extensive blocking of legitimate websites and apps, imposing significant costs on both suppliers and users of web-based services and products. According to the latest data, China currently blocks a significant portion of the largest global sites. U.S. industry research has calculated that more than 10,000 foreign sites are blocked, affecting billions of dollars in business, including communications, networking, app stores, news, and other sites. Even when sites are not permanently blocked, the often arbitrary implementation of blocking, and the performance-degrading effect of filtering all traffic into and outside of China, significantly impair the supply of many cross-border services, often to the point of making them unviable.",15,CHINA

For example, China prohibits retransmission of foreign TV channels, prohibits foreign investment in TV production, prohibits foreign investment in TV stations and channels in China, and imposes quotas on the amount of foreign programming that can be shown on a Chinese TV channel each day. In addition, in September 2018, the National Radio and Television Administration’s (NRTA) issued a problematic draft measure that would impose new restrictions in China’s already highly restricted market for foreign creative content. The draft measure would require that spending on foreign content account for no more than 30 percent of available total programs in each of several categories, including foreign movies, TV shows, cartoons, documentaries, and other foreign TV programs, made available for display via broadcasting institutions and online audiovisual-content platforms. It also would prohibit displaying foreign TV shows during prime time.",15,CHINA
Theatrical Films,"In February 2012, the United States and China reached an alternative resolution with regard to certain rulings relating to the importation and distribution of theatrical films in a WTO case that the United States had won. The two sides signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) providing for substantial increases in the number of foreign films imported and distributed in China each year, along with substantial additional revenue for U.S. film producers. However, as of March 2021, China has not yet fully implemented its MOU commitments, including with regard to critical commitments to open up film distribution opportunities for imported films. As a result, the United States has been pressing China for full implementation of the MOU. In 2017, in accordance with the terms of the MOU, the two sides began discussions regarding the provision of further meaningful compensation to the United States in an updated MOU. These discussions continued until March 2018, before stalling when China embarked on a major government reorganization that involved significant changes for China’s Film Bureau.

With respect to distribution platforms, NRTA (formerly the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film, and Television) has required Chinese online platform suppliers to spend no more than 30 percent of their acquisition budget on foreign content. NRTA has also instituted numerous measures that prevent foreign suppliers from qualifying for a license, such as requirements that video platforms all be Chinese-owned.

In the most recent iteration of the Foreign Investment Negative List, issued in June 2020, China added a new, explicit prohibition on the ability of a foreign lawyer to become a partner in a domestic law firm. Reportedly, China is also considering draft regulatory measures that would even further restrict the ability of foreign law firms to operate in China.",15,CHINA
Express Delivery Services,"The United States continues to have concerns regarding China’s implementation of the 2009 Postal Law and related regulations through which China prevents foreign service suppliers from participating in the document segment of its domestic express delivery market. In the package segment, China applies overly burdensome and inconsistent regulatory approaches, including with regard to security inspections, and reportedly appears to provide more favorable treatment to Chinese service suppliers when awarding business permits.",15,CHINA
Data Restrictions,"Various draft and final measures being developed by China’s regulatory authorities to implement China’s Cybersecurity Law, which took effect in June 2017, and China’s National Security Law, which has been in effect since 2015, would prohibit or severely restrict cross-border transfers of information that are routine in the ordinary course of business and are fundamental to any business activity. These measures also would impose local data storage and processing requirements on companies in “critical information infrastructure sectors,” a term that the Cybersecurity Law defines in broad and vague terms. China’s draft Personal Information Protection Law, issued for public comment in October 2020, also would include restrictions on cross-border data flows and requirements to store and process data locally. Given the wide range of business activities that are dependent on cross-border transfers of information and flexible access to global computing facilities, these developments have generated serious concerns among governments as well as among stakeholders in the United States and other countries, including among services suppliers. 128 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS",15,CHINA

Overview,"One of the core principles reflected throughout China’s WTO accession agreement is transparency. Unfortunately, as of March 2021, there remains a lot more work for China to do in this area.",15,CHINA
Publication of Trade-related Measures,"In its WTO accession agreement, China committed to adopt a single official journal for the publication of all trade-related laws, regulations, and other measures. China adopted a single official journal, to be administered by the MOFCOM, in 2006. Many years later, however, it appears that some, but not all, central-government entities publish trade-related measures in this journal, and these government entities tend to take a narrow view of the types of trade-related measures that need to be published in the official journal. These government entities more commonly (but still not regularly) publish trade-related administrative regulations and departmental rules in the journal, but it is less common for them to publish other measures such as opinions, circulars, orders, directives, and notices, even though they are in fact all binding legal measures. In addition, China rarely publishes certain types of trade-related measures in the journal, such as subsidy measures, and seldom publishes sub-central government trade-related measures in the journal.",15,CHINA
Notice-and-comment Procedures,"In its WTO accession agreement, China committed to provide a reasonable period for public comment before implementing new trade-related laws, regulations, and other measures. While little progress has been made in implementing this commitment at the sub-central government level, the National People’s Congress (NPC) instituted notice-and-comment procedures for draft laws in 2008, and shortly thereafter China indicated that it would also publish proposed trade- and economic-related administrative regulations and departmental rules for public comment. Subsequently, the NPC began regularly publishing draft laws for public comment. China’s State Council often (but not regularly) published draft administrative regulations for public comment. In addition, many of China’s ministries were not consistent in publishing draft departmental rules for public comment. At the May 2011 S&ED meeting, China committed to issue a measure implementing the requirement to publish all proposed trade- and economic-related administrative regulations and departmental rules on the website of the State Council’s Legislative Affairs Office (SCLAO) for a public comment period of not less than 30 days. In April 2012, the SCLAO issued two measures that appear to address this requirement. Despite continuing U.S. engagement, China still needs to improve its practices relating to the publication of administrative regulations and departmental rules for public comment. China also needs to formalize and improve its use of notice-and-comment procedures for so-called “normative documents,” which are regulatory documents that do not fall into the category of administrative regulations or departmental rules but still impose binding obligations on enterprises and individuals. However, China did commit in the Phase One Agreement to provide no less than 45 days for public comment on all proposed laws, regulations, and other measures implementing the Phase One Agreement. Since this commitment entered into force in February 2020, China has generally been providing the required 45-day public comment period and working constructively with the United States whenever it raises questions or concerns regarding provisions in proposed measures implementing the Phase One Agreement.",15,CHINA

Sanitary and Phytosanitary Barriers,"The Costa Rican Ministry of Agriculture occasionally delays the issuance of sanitary import permits for sensitive products, such as rice and onions, during specific periods, such as harvest time (usually in November to December for rice, and from April to June for onions). In addition, persistent issues remain regarding at-border processes and market access for fresh U.S. potatoes, both for chipping and table stock potatoes. The table stock market is currently closed pending completion of a pest risk assessment. During 2020, the United States exported $876,760 worth of chipping potatoes to Costa Rica. However, industry estimates that exports could increase to over $5 million if sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) issues are addressed and the table stock market is reopened. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and the Costa Rican Ministry of Agriculture conduct frequent bilateral meetings to discuss regulatory procedures for the import and export of new products, promoting market access for new U.S. products. FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 139 U.S. exporters continue to complain about the high cost of quarantine fumigations at Costa Rican ports of entry. Quarantine fumigations are a remediation measure that may be needed when quarantine pests are intercepted in shipments. On November 25, 2019, the United States reached an agreement with Costa Rica to eliminate re-inspection of cargo after it is fumigated. The new protocol was field tested and given final approval on June 6, 2020 and should reduce the time and costs that exporters incur for cargo at port. The U.S. Government continues to meet with the Plant Health and Customs Department to identify ways in which the cost of fumigation may be reduced. Costa Rica has a 2016 regulation requiring extensive questionnaires for animal product facilities that export products to Costa Rica. Most U.S. exporting facilities find this process overly burdensome and have complained that the questionnaire requests irrelevant business proprietary information. Many of the exporting facilities that have completed the questionnaires have yet to be registered by the Government of Costa Rica. Although U.S. companies have complained that dairy products are the most affected by this requirement, the measure also affects seafood, lamb, and egg products.",17,COSTA RICA
GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT,"U.S. companies have indicated that the private sector is sometimes disadvantaged in public bids when competing against Costa Rican state-owned enterprises in both the ICT and insurance sectors. Article 2 of the Public Contracting Law allows for the non-competitive awarding of contracts to public entities if officials of the awarding entity certify the award to be an efficient use of public funds. A leading business association asserts that, in 2019, the Costa Rican Government invoked Article 2 in 86 instances for a total contracted amount of $27.5 million in ICT goods and services. As part of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) accession process, Costa Rica has committed to work to reduce the total value of contracts awarded under Article 2 exceptions. However, the number of contracts awarded with exceptions continues to increase. Private sector insurance companies and brokers have complained that Costa Rica preferentially contracts with the state-owned insurance company, Instituto Nacional de Seguros (INS). In 2017, however, the Social Security Administration contracted with a private insurance company. In 2019, there was a re-bid for that same contract and the private company won, based both on cost and the company’s demonstrated good service in paying claims. This may signal a trend towards more competitive insurance contracting by government entities. The United States will continue to monitor Costa Rica’s government procurement practices to ensure they are consistent with CAFTA–DR obligations. The electronic procurement platform, Sistema Integrado de Compras Públicas (SICOP), provides a single purchasing platform for all participating ministries with an entirely paperless procurement process based on a secure database, allowing enhanced levels of transparency and competition in the procurement process. All Costa Rican Government agencies are legally obligated to migrate to the system, and most have done so as of October 2020. As a digital platform, SICOP requires that suppliers use the Costa Rican digital signature; however, SICOP offers an alternative digital signature for foreign suppliers through GlobalSign and, as of March 2021, approximately 700 foreign firms had registered through that facility, many of them actively participating with bids. Costa Rica is not a Party to the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Government Procurement, but has been an observer to the WTO Committee on Government Procurement since June 2015.

GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT,"The Government publishes tender notices in the local press and sometimes publishes tenders in international magazines and newspapers. On occasion, there is a charge for the bidding documents. Cote d’Ivoire has a generally decentralized government procurement system, with most ministries undertaking their own procurements. The National Bureau of Technical and Development Studies, the Government’s technical and investment planning agency and think tank, sometimes serves as an executing agency in major projects to be financed by international institutions. The Public Procurement Department is a centralized office of public tenders in the Ministry of Finance, to help ensure compliance with international bidding practices. Cote d’Ivoire’s update to its public procurement code in 2019 introduced electronic procurement bidding, provisions on sustainable public procurement, and promotion of socially responsible vendors as a bidding qualification. While the public procurement process is open by law, in practice it is often opaque and government contracts are occasionally awarded outside of public tenders.

FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 145 The Ivoirian investment code provides tax incentives for investments larger than $1 million, as well as land concessions for projects. Concessionary agreements that exempt investors from tax payments require the additional approval of the Ministry of Finance and Economy and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. The clearance procedure for planned investments, if the investor seeks tax breaks, is time consuming and confusing. Even when companies have complied fully with the requirements, the Tax Office sometimes denies tax exemptions with little explanation, giving rise to accusations of favoritism. In August 2018, the Government adopted a new investment code that prioritizes agriculture, agro-industry, health, and hospitality, and that links some incentives to productive and sustainable investments, and the promotion of local content – namely local job creation, subcontracting with local companies (especially small- and medium-sized enterprises), and the opening of share capital to local investors.

While HAGB can transmit complaints to government officials, the agency has no power to enforce anti-corruption laws and regulations. Corruption and lack of capacity in the judicial and security services have resulted in poor enforcement of private property rights, particularly when the affected company is foreign and the plaintiff is Ivoirian or a long-established foreign resident.

GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT,"Government procurement in Ecuador can be cumbersome and nontransparent. Payments can often be delayed without explanation despite provision of goods and services and proper work orders and receipts. The lack of transparency poses a risk that procuring entities will administer a procurement to the advantage FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 155 of a preferred supplier. Ecuador’s Public Procurement Law establishes exceptions for procurements made according to special rules established by presidential decrees, for exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons, for emergency situations, and for national security contracts. Article 34 of the Public Procurement Law allows public enterprises to follow special procurement rules, provided the National Public Procurement Service issues an open-ended authorization for purchases considered within “the nature of the enterprise.” In May, 2020, the Ecuadorian President issued Executive Decree 1033 reforming the Public Procurement Regulations and assigning the National Public Procurement Service (SERCOP) a leadership role in the implementation of a new Unified System for the Purchase of Medicines and Strategic Goods for the Health Sector (the “Unified System”). This decree provides for unifying and reorganizing the medical supply and distribution system nationwide. The technology-based system aims to provide full traceability, transparency, and accountability from prescription through consumption, while optimizing the distribution and storage of medicines using a privately contracted, specialized logistics operator. Although a positive step, the Ecuadorian pharmaceutical industry reports that the proposed system needs further adjustments, including to ensure qualified bidders, product traceability, and realistic timelines for implementation. The system, which was in planning stages since October 2019, will be fully operational in 2021. Ecuador also requires that preferential treatment be given to locally produced goods, especially those produced under the framework of the constitutionally established “social and solidarity economy,” as well as micro and small enterprises. Foreign bidders are required to register and submit bids for government procurement through an online system, Servicio Nacional de Contratación Pública – Ecuador – Sercop. Foreign bidders must have a local legal representative in order to participate in government procurement. To sell goods or services to Petroamazonas or Petroecuador, foreign bidders must register with each entity to become official suppliers.

Other Investment Barriers,"Regulations and laws since 2007 limit private sector participation by foreign or domestic sources in sectors deemed “strategic.” These apply additional limitations to foreign private sector participation in select sectors such as the extractive industries. In 2010, then-President Rafael Correa enacted Executive Decree 546, which mandated the modification of existing production sharing contracts with oil companies into service provision contracts (fixed price per barrel). Additionally, the decree limited the conditions under which state-owned upstream oil company Petroamazonas or its subsidiaries could employ contractual forms other than service provision contracts. Unlike production sharing contracts, the payment structure of service provision contracts does not provide the same level of incentives for private companies to invest in activities that increase production. After the fall in global oil prices in mid-2014, the Ecuadorian Government began relaxing its extractive industries regulatory framework to attract foreign investment in the petroleum and mining sectors. Presidential Decree 449 of July 2018 allowed Petroamazonas to issue production sharing contracts, with certain limitations. The government signed contracts for seven blocks under this model (Ronda Intracampos I) in May 2019, and plans to auction additional blocks in successive rounds (Ronda Intracampos II, Suroriente, Subandino, and one offshore). While this reform attracted exploration and production investment, Decree 546 still prohibits the use of production-sharing contracts for existing wells, which limits private sector participation in the bidding process for such wells. According to U.S. stakeholders, prohibitions on commingling (mixing of petroleum from multiple companies in a pipeline for transport) in Ecuador’s petroleum sector limit the productive capacity of oil companies by roughly 10 percent, inhibiting investment. A restrictive environmental permitting process requires six or more months for oil projects and an average of 18 months for mining projects. In 2019, the Environment Ministry reformed regulations to streamline the process, but challenges remain for companies given insufficient and untrained ministry staff tasked with processing the permits. The 2015 Mining Law allows the state to grant mining exploitation rights to private and foreign entities, depending on national interests.

The EU’s average MFN applied tariff rate was 12.7 percent for agricultural products and 3.9 percent for non-agricultural products in 2019 (latest data available). The EU has bound 100 percent of its tariff lines in the WTO, with an average WTO bound tariff rate of 5.1 percent. Although the EU’s tariffs are generally low for non-agricultural goods, some EU tariffs are high, such as rates of up to 26 percent for fish and seafood, 22 percent for trucks, 14 percent for bicycles, 10 percent for passenger vehicles, 10 percent for processed wood products, and 6.5 percent for fertilizers and plastics. On June 20, 2018, the EU adopted additional tariffs ranging from 10 percent to 25 percent on a range of agricultural products, consumer products, and industrial products and materials imported from the United States in retaliation against the President’s decision to adjust U.S. imports of steel and aluminum articles under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended.

Sanitary and Phytosanitary Barriers,"The United States remains concerned about a number of measures the EU maintains ostensibly for the purposes of food safety and protecting human, animal, or plant life or health. Specifically, the United States is concerned that these measures unnecessarily restrict trade without furthering their safety objectives because they are not based on scientific principles, are maintained without sufficient scientific evidence, or are applied beyond the extent necessary. As part of the European Green Deal announced in December 2019 (aimed at making Europe “the first carbon neutral continent by 2050”), the Commission published its F2F Strategy in May 2020, which included targets and policy proposals for enhancing food and agricultural sustainability by 2030. These targets aim to reduce pesticide and fertilizer use by farmers, antimicrobial use in livestock, and land for crop use by transitioning farmland into organic production and idling other farmland.

Government Support for Airbus,"Over many years, France, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom (as well as, to a much lesser extent, Belgium) have provided subsidies to their Airbus-affiliated companies to aid in the development, production, and marketing of Airbus’s large civil aircraft. These governments have financed from 33 percent to 100 percent of the development costs (launch aid) of all Airbus aircraft models and have provided other forms of support, including equity infusions, debt forgiveness, debt rollovers, marketing assistance, and research and development funding, in addition to political and economic pressure on purchasing governments. The EU aeronautics research programs are driven significantly by a policy intended to enhance the international competitiveness of the EU civil aeronautics industry. Member State governments have spent hundreds of millions of euros to create infrastructure for Airbus programs, including €751 million (approximately $$910 million) spent by the city of Hamburg to drain the wetlands that Airbus is currently using as an assembly site for the A380 “superjumbo” aircraft.

GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT,"Government procurement is governed by the EU public procurement directives. In 2014, the European Parliament approved revised directives addressing general public procurement and procurement in the utilities sector. The Parliament also approved a new directive on concessions contracts. Member States were required to transpose the new directives into national legislation by April 2016. The directive on procurement in the utilities sector covers purchases in the water, transportation, energy, and postal sectors. This directive requires open and competitive bidding procedures, but it permits Member States to reject bids with less than 50 percent EU content for tenders that are not covered by an international or reciprocal bilateral agreement. The EU content requirement applies to foreign suppliers of goods and services in water (the production, transport, and distribution of drinking water), energy (gas and heat), urban transport (urban rail, automated systems, trams, buses, etc.), and postal services. Subsidiaries of U.S. companies may bid on all public procurement contracts covered by the EU directives. The EU is a Party to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA). U.S.-based companies are allowed to bid on public tenders covered by the GPA. In July 2019, the EU published guidance to public buyers in Member States on participation of third country (non-GPA or non-trade agreement partners) bidders in the EU procurement market, aimed at reinforcing the importance of reducing predatory low-priced bids. This guidance does not change the access that U.S. companies have to the EU under the GPA. However, the guidance provides neither a definition of what constitutes an abnormally low bid, nor a method to conduct the evaluation. While a public buyer must give the third country bidder an opportunity to explain and justify a low-priced bid, Member States are free to set up national rules and methods to implement this process. The EU’s lack of country-of-origin data for winning bids makes it difficult to assess the level of U.S. and non-EU participation. The most recent report, commissioned by the EU in 2011, noted that only 1.6 percent of total Member State procurement contracts were awarded to firms operating and bidding from another Member State or a non-EU country, demonstrating that in practice the value of direct cross-border procurement awards even among Member States was very small. The same study said that U.S. firms not established in the EU received just 0.016 percent of total EU direct cross-border procurement awards.",23,EUROPEAN UNION
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION,"As part of its Digital Single Market (DSM) Strategy, the Commission on September 14, 2016, issued a proposed Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market (Directive on Copyright) with the stated goal of addressing legal uncertainty for both right holders and users with regard to certain uses of copyright- protected works and other subject matter in the digital environment. The Directive on Copyright was published on April 17, 2019, and Member States must transpose it by June 7, 2021. The United States continues to follow copyright issues in the EU and its Member States, including legislative developments relating to the transposition of the Directive on Copyright into national laws, and will continue to engage with various EU entities as appropriate to address the equities of U.S. stakeholders. The United States also will closely monitor the EU Commission’s Digital Services Act (DSA) proposal, another legislative initiative that purports to govern online services and how content is shared online. In January 2016, Trademark Directive 2015/2436 and Regulation 2015/2424 entered into force. Some of the articles of the directive needed to be transposed by the Member States by January 14, 2019, and others must be transposed by January 14, 2023. The United States continues to work with the EU and its Member States on trademark issues and is closely following implementation of the trademark package. The United States remains highly troubled by the EU’s overbroad protection of geographical indications (GIs), which adversely impacts both protection of U.S. trademarks and market access for U.S. products that use common names in the EU and third country markets. Regulation 1151/2012, for example, contains numerous problematic provisions with respect to the protection and enforcement of Protected Designations of Origin (PDOs) and Protected Geographical Indications (PGIs). Troubling provisions include those governing the scope of protection of PDOs and PGIs, including expansive rules about evocation, extension, co-existence, and translation, among others, which not only adversely affect trademark rights and the ability to use common names, but also undermine access to the EU market for U.S. rights holders and producers.

Digital Services Taxation,"Over the past two years, a number of Member States have taken under consideration or adopted taxes on revenues that certain companies generate from providing certain digital services to, or aimed at, users in jurisdictions. These taxes are generally referred to as digital services taxes (DSTs). Available evidence suggests the DSTs are targeted at large, U.S.-based technology companies. For its part, the Commission has also stated that it may propose again an EU-wide DST and included such a tax as an option to generate revenues to pay for the EU COVID-19 relief package. The United States opposes proposals by any country to single out digital companies. In addition, U.S. companies have expressed concerns that the specific services included in the proposal, along with the thresholds for global and EU-wide revenues, appear to target almost exclusively U.S. companies, thereby having a discriminatory effect on U.S. suppliers participating in EU markets.

GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT,"U.S. suppliers of goods and services face difficulties accessing the Ghanaian procurement market. Some large public procurements are conducted with open tendering and allow the participation of foreign firms. However, despite recent Government of Ghana statements about reductions in single source procurements, single source procurements remain common. Guidelines that apply to current tenders open to international competitive bidding give a margin of preference of 7.5 percent to 20 percent to domestic suppliers of goods and services. In July 2020, the Ghanaian Government issued a directive to public institutions for preferential procurement of locally assembled vehicles. Notwithstanding the public procurement law, companies report that locally funded contracts lack full transparency. Supplier- or foreign government- subsidized financing arrangements appear in some cases to be a crucial factor in the award of government procurements. Allegations of corruption persist in the tender processes across ministries. In a positive example of accountability, the Ghanaian President fired the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Ghana’s Public Procurement Authority on October 30, 2020, following a 14-month investigation by the Commission for Human Rights and Administrative Justice into the CEO’s conflicts of interest.

INVESTMENT BARRIERS,"All foreign investment projects must be registered with the Ghana Investment Promotion Center. Registration is designed to be completed within five business days, but often takes significantly longer. Foreign investments are also subject to the following minimum capital requirements: $200,000 for joint ventures with a Ghanaian partner; $500,000 for enterprises wholly-owned by a non-Ghanaian; and, $1 million for trading companies (firms that buy or sell imported goods or services) that are wholly owned by non-Ghanaian entities. Trading companies are also required to employ at least 20 skilled Ghanaian nationals. Ghana’s investment code excludes foreign investors from participating in eight economic sectors: petty trading; the operation of taxi and automobile rental services with fleets of fewer than 25 vehicles; lotteries (excluding soccer pools); the operation of beauty salons and barber shops; printing of recharge scratch cards for subscribers to telecommunications services; production of exercise books and stationery; retail of finished pharmaceutical products; and the production, supply, and retail of drinking water in sealed pouches. At times, foreign investors experience difficulties and delays in securing required work visas for their non- Ghanaian employees. The process for obtaining required such visas can be unpredictable and take several months from application to delivery. Obtaining access to land may also be challenging for foreign investors. Foreigners are allowed to enter into long-term leases of up to 50 years, and the lease may be bought, sold, or renewed for consecutive terms. Foreigners are permitted to acquire interests in land only on a long-term FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 233 leasehold basis, and Ghana’s complex land tenure system makes establishing clear title on real estate difficult. Foreign investors in Ghana also may encounter a politicized business community and a lack of transparency in certain government operations. Entrenched local interests can derail or delay new entrants. The political leanings of the Ghanaian partners of foreign investors are often subject to government scrutiny. Corruption among government and business figures also remains a concern. Ghana’s anticorruption laws provide Ghanaian law enforcement and judicial bodies robust legal powers to fight corruption in the country, but these laws are not enforced consistently. Foreign investors have expressed concerns regarding respect for contract sanctity in Ghana, including threats to abrogate contracts, unilateral changes to contract terms, and forced contract renegotiations with the government and its state-owned enterprises. The concerns are undermining confidence in Ghana’s investment climate.",24,GHANA
Mining,"Ghana restricts the issuance of mining licenses based on the size of the mining operation. Pursuant to the Minerals and Mining Act, 2006 (Act 703), foreign investors are restricted from obtaining a small-scale mining license for mining operations of an area less than or equal to 25 acres (10 hectares). In 2019, the criminal penalty for non-compliance with the regulation on mining or promoting mining without a license, and the buying or selling of minerals without a license, was increased from a maximum prison sentence of five years, to a minimum of 15 years for a Ghanaian and 20 years for a non-Ghanaian, with a maximum sentence of 25 years. The change was intended to discourage unlicensed small-scale mining. Non- Ghanaians may apply for a mineral right with regard to industrial minerals only for projects involving an investment of at least $10 million. The 2006 Minerals and Mining Act mandates compulsory local participation, whereby the Government acquires a 10 percent equity stake in ventures at no cost. In order to qualify for a license, a non-Ghanaian company must be registered in Ghana, either as a branch office or a subsidiary incorporated under the Ghana Companies Act, signed in 2019, or Private Partnership Act.",24,GHANA
Oil and Gas,"The oil and gas sector is subject to a variety of state ownership and local content requirements. The 2016 Petroleum (Exploration and Production) Act mandates local participation. All entities seeking petroleum exploration and development licenses in Ghana must create a consortium in which the state-owned Ghana National Petroleum Corporation holds a minimum 15 percent participating carried interest, and a local Ghanaian firm or individual holds a minimum five percent interest. The Petroleum Commission issues all licenses, but Parliament must approve all exploration licenses. Further, local content regulations specify in-country sourcing requirements with respect to goods, services, hiring, and training associated with petroleum operations – standards that many international companies describe as unattainable or burdensome. These regulations also require mandatory local equity participation for all suppliers and contractors. The Minister of Energy must approve all contracts, subcontracts, and purchase orders above $100,000, and notably has the authority to alter the requirements set by law for any specific contract. The criteria for the Minister’s approval of local equity partners in commercial transactions remain unclear, which raises concerns of potential corruption and favoritism in the selection of local equity partners in government-approved concessions or contracts. Non-compliance with these regulations may result in a criminal penalty, including imprisonment for up to five years. 234 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS",24,GHANA
Local Content and Location Participation Requirements,"In December 2017, Ghana introduced regulations requiring local content and local participation in the power sector. The Energy Commission (Local Content and Local Participation) (Electricity Supply Industry) Regulations, 2017 (L.I. 2354) specify minimum initial levels of local participation/ownership and 10-year targets. The regulations also specify minimum and target levels of local content in engineering and procurement, construction works, post construction works, services, management, operations and staff. All persons engaged in or planning to engage in the supply of electricity are required to register with the Electricity Supply Local Content and Local Participation Committee and satisfy the minimum local content and participation requirements within five years. Failure to comply with the requirements could result in a fine or imprisonment. There are specific provisions in the mining regulations that require mining entities to procure goods and services from local sources. The Minerals Commission publishes a Local Procurement List, which identifies items that must be sourced from Ghanaian-owned companies, whose directors must all be Ghanaians. Effective January 1, 2019, security services have a 100 percent local content mandate. Under the Classification of New Services Under the Minerals and Mining (Support Services) Regulations, 2012 (LI 2174), Ghana restricts Class B mining support services, which include catering, camp management, and security services, to Ghanaians only.

Honduras eliminated tariffs on yellow corn and pork as of January 1, 2020. Honduras will eliminate tariffs on rice and chicken leg quarters by 2023, and on dairy products by 2025. For certain products, tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) permit some duty-free access for specified quantities during the tariff phase-out period, with the duty-free quantities expanding during that period. Honduras will liberalize trade in white corn through continual expansion of a TRQ, rather than by the reduction of the out-of-quota tariff. Honduras is required under the CAFTA–DR to make TRQs available on January 1 of each year. Honduras monitors its TRQs through an import licensing system, which the United States is carefully tracking to ensure the timely issuance of these permits. FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 241",26,HONDURAS

SUBSIDIES,Export Subsidies,28,INDIA
Export Subsidies,"India’s Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) 2015-2020, announced in April 2015, is primarily focused on increasing India’s exports of goods and services to raise India’s share of world exports from 2 percent to 3.5 percent. The FTP consolidated many of India’s existing export subsidies and other incentives into two main export incentive schemes: the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS), and the Service Exports Incentive Scheme (SEIS). Under MEIS, exports of notified goods and products to notified markets as listed in Appendix 3B of the Handbook of Procedures, are granted freely transferable duty credit scrips on realized FOB value of exports in free foreign exchange at specified rates. These range from 2 percent to 5 percent, with temporary increases as high as 20 percent. MEIS provides export subsidies for a wide range of agriculture and other goods, including certain dairy products which also receive export subsidy support through state governments. Service suppliers of notified services as per Appendix 3E are eligible for freely transferable duty credit scrip at five percent of net foreign exchange earned. In addition, there are various other duty exemption and remission schemes, such as the Advanced Authorization Scheme, the Duty Free Import Authorization Scheme, the Deemed Exports Scheme, the Export Promotion Capital Goods (EPCG) Scheme, and the Export Oriented Unit (EOU) Scheme (which includes the Electronics Hardware Technology Park Scheme, Software Technology Park Scheme, and Bio-Technology Park Scheme). India also maintains several export subsidy programs, including exemptions from taxes, for certain export- oriented enterprises and for exporters in special economic zones. Numerous sectors (e.g., textiles and apparel, steel, paper, rubber, toys, leather goods, wood products) receive various forms of subsidies, including exemptions from customs duties and internal taxes. India not only continues to offer subsidies to its textiles and apparel sector in order to promote exports, but has also extended or expanded such programs and even implemented new export subsidy programs. As a result, the Indian textiles sector remains a beneficiary of many export promotion measures. In July 2016, India announced subsidies intended to encourage employment generation in the garment sector, in addition to providing refunds for state levies. FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 257 Upon graduation from Annex VII(b) of the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement) in 2017, India was required to eliminate all export subsidies. In 2018, the United States commenced WTO dispute settlement proceedings against India concerning India’s continued export subsidy schemes. On October 31, 2019, the panel found that five Indian export subsidy programs provide prohibited subsidies that are inconsistent with India’s WTO obligations. The Indian programs found to be inconsistent are the MEIS, the EOU scheme, the Special Economic Zones scheme, the EPCG scheme, and a duty-free imports for exporters program. India appealed the panel report in November 2019. India has begun to phase out the MEIS program, under which reportedly no new benefits could be claimed starting January 1, 2021. The MEIS program is being replaced with the Remission of Duties and Taxes on Export Product (RoDTEP) program, for which India has not published implementing measures as of the date of this report but has stated that benefits would be available for exports made on or after January 1, 2021. RoDTEP is modeled after the Rebate on State and Local Taxes and Levies (RoSCTL) scheme, which is currently operated by the Ministry of Textiles and is limited to apparel sector exports. Like MEIS, RoDTEP benefits are expected to be available for a broad range of products; in fact, press reports suggest that RoDTEP will surpass MEIS in terms of revenue forgone by India. India also maintains a large and complex series of programs that form the basis of its public food stockholding program. India maintains stocks of food grains not only for distribution to poor and needy consumers, but also to stabilize prices through open market sales. India uses export subsidies to reduce stocks, and it has permitted exports of certain agricultural commodities from government public- stockholding reserves at below the government’s costs. For example, India authorized the exportation of 6.5 million metric tons of wheat from government-held stocks during August 2012 to May 2014 at varying minimum export prices significantly below the government’s acquisition cost of $306 per ton, plus storage, handling, inland transportation cost, and other charges for exports. In February 2014, the Indian Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs made four million metric tons (MMT) of raw sugar eligible to receive export subsidies under a new, two-year subsidy program, which lapsed in September 2015. The United States, along with other interested WTO Member countries, has raised this issue in the WTO Committee on Agriculture. Later in September 2015, the Indian Government introduced the Minimum Indicative Export Quota (MIEQ) program to sell four MMT of sugar, which ran through June 2016. In March 2018, the Indian Government re-introduced the MIEQ program to sell two MMT of sugar through September 2018. However, citing poor export sales, the program was extended by three months to December 2018 to meet the two MMT target. Anticipating rising arrears for cane sugar mills and a large sugar stock, in August 2019, the Indian Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs approved another sugar export subsidy of 10,448 Indian rupees (approximately $149 per MT) for sugar mills during marketing year 2019/2020. The total expenditure for this program is expected to be approximately $876.7 million. The subsidy is provided to cover marketing expenses and both internal and international freight charges. The Maximum Admissible Export Quantity allocated to sugar mills for this program is six MMT. The subsidy is paid directly to the farmers on behalf of the mills against payments that are due, and any remaining balance would be paid to the mills.",28,INDIA
GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT,"India lacks an overarching government procurement policy and, as a result, its government procurement practices and procedures vary among the states, between the states and the central government, and among different ministries within the central government. Multiple procurement rules, guidelines, and procedures issued by multiple bodies have resulted in problems with transparency, accountability, competition, and efficiency in public procurement. A recent World Bank report stated that the state-owned Public Sector Undertakings uses over 150 different contract formats, each with different qualification criteria, selection processes, and financial requirements. India also provides preferences to Indian micro, small, and medium enterprises and to state-owned enterprises. Moreover, in defense procurements, India’s offset program requires companies to invest 30 percent or more of the acquisition cost of contracts above the threshold value in Indian-produced parts, equipment, or services, a requirement that continues to prove challenging for manufacturers of high-technology equipment. In September 2020, the Indian Ministry of Defense announced the final Defense Acquisition Procedures (DAP) 2020, which replaces the Defense Procurement Procedure of 2016 and is effective from October 1, 2020 until September 30, 2025. Under the DAP 2020, acquisition categories of “Buy (Indian),” “Buy (Indian – Indigenously Designed Developed and Manufactured)” (also referred to as “Buy (Indian- IDDM)”), and “Buy and Make (Indian)” have an indigenous content requirement. India’s National Manufacturing Policy calls for increased use of local content requirements in government procurement in certain sectors (e.g., information communications technology and clean energy). Consistent with this approach, India issued the Preferential Market Access notification, which requires government entities to meet their needs for electronic products in part by purchasing domestically manufactured goods. Subsequently, in June 2017, the Department of Industry Policy and Promotion issued two notifications under the Public Procurement “Preferential Electronics Order” and “Cyber Notification” to state governments and central agencies mandating preferences for domestically manufactured electronic goods, FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 259 which include hardware, for the purpose of government procurement as well as, more recently, cyber security software products. The notification indicates that this requirement will apply to procurement by government, government companies, and other procuring entities. This notification is the culmination of similar Indian policy proposals that have outlined discriminatory government procurement policies as a means to stimulate domestic manufacturing of electronics and telecommunications equipment at the expense of foreign companies that have invested heavily in India. On June 4, 2020, the Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) issued a revision to its 2017 procurement order, titled Public Procurement (Preference to Make in India) Order 2020. The rule was updated again on September 19, 2020. The Order took immediate effect and instructs each nodal ministry or department to draft a follow-on procurement order that favors domestic suppliers. Though the new Order does not appear to impact tenders or procurements announced prior to June 4, 2020, it will hinder U.S. industry’s ability to participate in central government tenders. Moreover, the August 2020 changes to General Financial Rules section 161 state that global tender enquiries may not be accepted under $31 million. Any reductions of the minimum local content requirement cannot be implemented without permission of an appropriate authority. Furthermore, companies must use a third-party or internal auditor to certify the amount of local content that will be used if the value is equal to or greater than 10 Crore ($1.36 million). In addition, in the September 19, 2020 update, the minimum local content requirement was expanded, permitting Ministries and Departments to mandate higher local content percentages that could be used to benefit Indian suppliers and prevent U.S. companies from participating in government tenders. On September 23, 2020, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy released an order reserving a list of 80 products, including solar cells, modules, wind turbines, and electrical equipment for hydro and biogas for bidding only by “Class 1 local suppliers” irrespective of the purchase value. The Ministry of Power also reserved 86 products for local procurement through a similar order published on September 17, 2020. On April 29, 2020, the MEITY issued a notification that entities must procure cellular mobile phones only from local suppliers meeting the local content requirement of 50 percent, irrespective of purchase value.

Audiovisual Services,"U.S. companies have reported that India’s satellite programming downlinking policy is overly burdensome, including the requirement for foreign programmers to establish a registered office in India or designate a local agent. Programmers must also prove that they have a net worth of 50 million rupees (approximately $700,000) in order to downlink one content channel and an additional 25 million rupees (approximately $350,000) of net worth for each additional channel. The Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of India’s regulations on content aggregation and distribution do not allow bundling of channels and certain types of distribution partnerships. Content aggregation is commonly used internationally, as it allows niche and foreign content to be bundled and sold by domestic partners without a large local presence or sales force. These regulations cause particular difficulties for small and international content providers because these companies must interact with each of the 60,000 local cable operators, radio broadcasters, and television broadcasters that they seek to target. There are also a number of limits on foreign ownership in the audiovisual and media sectors: cable networks (49 percent); FM radio (26 percent); head end in the sky (74 percent); direct-to-home (DTH) broadcasting (74 percent); teleports (74 percent); news broadcasting (26 percent); and, newspapers (26 percent). In August 2019, the Indian Government allowed foreign direct investment (FDI) of up to 26 percent for digital media firms that upload and stream news and current affairs.",28,INDIA
Distribution Services,"India imposes certain restrictions on FDI in the retail industry. With respect to single-brand retail, foreign investments exceeding 51 percent are contingent on, among other things, a requirement to source at least 30 percent of the value of products sold from Indian sources, preferably from small and medium-sized enterprises. India has modified the requirements in recent years, including by allowing firms to offset the local sourcing requirement by sourcing products from India for global supply chains. Despite these modifications, the local content requirements remain prohibitive for certain retailers with highly specialized supply chains. India caps foreign ownership in the multi-brand retail sector at 51 percent, and leaves to each Indian state the final decision on whether to authorize such FDI in its territory. In addition, where FDI is allowed, it is subject to conditions, including: (1) a minimum investment of approximately $100 million, at least 50 percent of which must be in “back-end infrastructure” (e.g., processing, distribution, quality control, packaging, logistics, storage, and warehouses); (2) a requirement to operate only in cities that have been identified by the relevant state government; and (3) a requirement to source at least 30 percent of the value of products sold from “small” Indian enterprises whose total investments in plant and machinery are under $2 million each.

The Union Cabinet of India approved a new National Education Policy (NEP) on July 29, 2020, to replace the three-decades old National Education Policy of 1986.

BARRIERS TO DIGITAL TRADE,Data Localization,28,INDIA
Data Localization,"India has recently proposed and promulgated a number of data localization requirements that would serve as significant barriers to digital trade between the United States and India. These requirements raise costs for service suppliers that store and process personal information outside India by forcing the construction or use of unnecessary, redundant local data centers. For smaller foreign firms that cannot afford redundant computing facilities within India, these requirements could serve as a total market access barrier. In 2018, the RBI implemented a requirement that all payment service suppliers store all information related to electronic payments by Indian citizens on servers located in India. RBI announced this rule without advance notice and without input from stakeholders. In June 2019, RBI stated that the requirement to store payments data locally also applies to banks operating in India. Requiring local storage of all payment information raises costs for service suppliers, and disadvantages foreign firms, which are more likely to be dependent on globally distributed data storage and information security systems. Furthermore, an only-in- India data storage requirement hampers the ability of service suppliers to detect fraud and ensure the security of their networks. In December 2019, the Indian Government introduced the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 in the Indian Parliament. The bill would require firms to store a copy of all “sensitive” and “critical” personal information related to Indian persons on a server located in India. Such “mirroring” requirements are ineffective in enhancing the protection of personal data and often weaken data security. The bill would also impose onerous conditions on the cross-border transfer of “sensitive” personal information, including “explicit consent” by the data principal. “Critical” personal information––an undefined category––could not be transferred out of India under any circumstances. Further, in the absence of standalone trade secret legislation, there is little recourse for firms in the instance of misappropriation of their sensitive information. These provisions would undermine the ability of foreign firms to supply many services to Indian consumers on a cross-border basis, and would not support the privacy of personal information. 266 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS",28,INDIA

Service providers are unable to buy dark fiber needed to build new networks, are prohibited from purchasing dual- use equipment needed to run networks, and are unable to own and manage a network to cross-connect data centers and connect directly to an Internet Exchange Point. These restrictions affect the ability of cloud services to effectively manage their own networks.",28,INDIA
Internet Services,"India’s national, state, and local governments regularly shut down Internet services in response to local unrest or to suppress certain digital content and services. Observers tallied over 75 separate major shutdowns in 2020, following more than 106 in 2019. Jammu and Kashmir experienced a 213-day Internet shutdown starting in August 2019, which was one of the longest Internet shutdowns by a democracy. Such shutdowns––even if temporary––undermine the value of Internet-based services to their customers and impose costs on local firms that depend on these services for their business. The absence of a safe harbor framework for Internet intermediaries related to non-IP-protected content shared by third parties discourages investment in Internet services that depend on user-generated content. India’s 2011 Information Technology Rules have provided an insufficient shield for online intermediaries from liability for non-IP third-party user content: any citizen can complain that certain content is “disparaging” or “harmful,” and intermediaries must respond by removing that content within 36 hours. Draft regulations announced in late 2018 (the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines) Rules 2018) threaten to further worsen India’s intermediary liability protections. These draft rules would require platforms to become proactive arbiters of “unlawful” content, shifting the onus of the state to private parties. If these draft rules come into force, they may incentivize overly restrictive approaches to policing non-IP",28,INDIA

Under the JNNSM, India imposes certain local content requirements (LCRs) for solar cells and modules, and requires participating solar power developers to use solar cells and modules made in India in order to enter into long-term power supply contracts and receive other benefits from the Indian Government. The United States challenged these LCRs through the WTO dispute settlement system. In February 2016, a WTO panel found India’s LCRs inconsistent with multiple WTO requirements. These findings were affirmed by the Appellate Body on September 16, 2016, and the DSB adopted the Appellate Body and panel reports on October 14, 2016.

The policy also required central government entities to publish draft legislation or a summary of information concerning the proposed legislation for a minimum period of 30 days. Issuance through electronic media was also encouraged in the policy, as were public consultations. However, despite U.S. requests, the Indian Government has provided no information on the implementation of the policy, other than to clarify it is only intended to apply to draft legislation, not regulations or tariff- setting. In addition, in May 2016, the Indian Supreme Court made a judgement concerning the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India in which it recommended that India’s Parliament “frame a legislation along the lines of the U.S. Administrative Procedure Act (with certain well-defined exceptions) by which all subordinate legislation is subject to a transparent process by which due consultations with all stakeholders are held, and the rule or regulation making power is exercised after due consideration of all stakeholders’ submissions.” U.S. stakeholders continue to report new requirements that are issued with inadequate public notice and comment periods and/or inadequate consultation or notification at the WTO. This lack of transparency imparts a lack of predictability to the Indian market, diminishing the ability of U.S. companies to enter or operate in that market and inhibiting India’s overall business environment. The United States continues to raise concerns regarding uniform notice and comment procedures with the Government of India, both bilaterally in the TPF and multilaterally in the WTO and other fora.

GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT,"Indonesia grants special preferences to encourage domestic sourcing and to maximize the use of local content in government procurement. It also instructs government departments, institutes, and corporations to utilize domestic goods and services to the maximum extent feasible. Presidential Regulations 54/2010 (as amended by Regulation 16/2018) and 38/2015 both require procuring entities to maximize local content in procurement, use foreign components only when necessary, and to designate foreign contractors as subcontractors to local companies. Both regulations provide general minimum requirements for local content and service provision. Depending on the sector or nature of the project, ministries with authority over the project may impose additional restrictions or requirements. In addition, the 2020 Job Creation Omnibus requires the central and local governments to allocate at least 40 percent of government procurement to local micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises in addition to cooperatives. Indonesia’s 2012 Defense Law and Presidential Regulation 76/2014 mandate priority for local materials and components and require defense agencies to use locally produced goods and services whenever available. In addition, when an Indonesian Government entity procures from a foreign defense supplier due to lack of availability from an Indonesian supplier, there is a requirement for “trade balancing” offsets, including by incorporation of local content, production offsets, technology transfer, or a combination thereof.

Franchising and Retail Distribution,"In 2019, the Minister of Trade issued Regulation 71/2019, which amends long-standing local content requirements in the franchising sector. On its face, Regulation 71/2019 appears to eliminate a 2012 requirement that 80 percent of products sold by retail companies be of Indonesian origin. However, Regulation 71/2019 still requires retail companies to “prioritize” the use of domestic goods and services unless domestic products do not meet a franchisor’s “quality standards.” Regulation 71/2019 also appears to eliminate a 2012 cap on the number of outlets a franchisor can directly own in Indonesia. Despite the removal of these restrictions, local content requirements and restrictions on the number of outlets appear to remain in force through other regulations. MOT Regulation 47/2016 continues to require 80 percent of retail merchandise to be local products, and Presidential Regulation 112/2007 continues to impose limitations on the number of outlets a franchisee may own. Additionally, under MOT Regulation 70/2013, domestic products must account for at least 80 percent of the total amount and types of goods sold by “modern” retail establishments. Also, under the regulation, private label products may account for a maximum of 15 percent of a modern retail establishment’s inventory. MOT Regulation 56/2014 provides an exception to the domestic product requirement for standalone brands or specialty stores selling products that meet any one the following criteria: (1) products requiring uniformity of production and sourcing from a global supply chain; (2) products with “world famous” or premium branding that are not yet produced in Indonesia; or, (3) products from certain countries sold to meet the needs of their citizens living in Indonesia. MOT Regulation 56/2014 also provides an exception to the 15 percent maximum private label products cap for stores that have a local partner, and exempts modern stores with more than 150 outlets from the local partner requirement.",29,INDONESIA
Telecommunications Services,"Indonesia has issued a number of measures that make it difficult to import cellular and Wi-Fi equipped products. Under MOT Regulation 82/2012 (as amended by MOT Regulation 41/2016) importers of cell phones, handheld computers, and tablets are not permitted to sell directly to retailers or consumers. Additionally, importers are required to become a “registered importer” and must confirm that they are working with at least three distributors and provide evidence of contributions to the development of the domestic device industry or cooperation with domestic manufacturing, design, or research firms in order to qualify for an MOT import license. U.S. companies have reported that, in some cases, MOI is informally limiting import quantities under existing licenses (issued under MOI Regulation 108/2012) to protect locally manufactured cell phones, handheld computers, and tablets. Companies seeking to import 4G-LTE enabled devices may only do so under a “producers license” (API-P), which is generally held by importers of unfinished goods intended for use in the manufacturing process, threatening to limit the ability of foreign producers to sell these devices in Indonesia. MOT Regulation 41/2016 also requires companies applying for an import license to submit product identification numbers and a certificate from the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT). Importers of any type of cell phone, handheld computer, or tablet are also subject to MOI Regulation 68/2016, which requires importers to obtain an MOI recommendation to establish themselves as registered importers of such devices. A recommendation is only available for local manufacturers, importers in a joint venture with a local manufacturer, or importers of “specialized items.” Altogether, Indonesia’s licensing practices impose significant barriers on the importation of cellphones, handheld devices, and other electronic devices. FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 281 To curb the illegal importation of cell phones, laptops, and tablets, MOI created an International Mobile Identity (IMEI) database that catalogs legally registered devices. Only devices that have an IMEI number registered in this database will be operational on Indonesian networks.

Other barriers to trade and investment include poor coordination within the Indonesian Government, limited access to financing, the slow pace of land acquisition for infrastructure development projects, poor enforcement of contracts, an uncertain regulatory and legal framework, arbitrary tax assessments, and lack of transparency in the development of laws and regulations. U.S. companies seeking legal relief in contract disputes have reported that they are often forced to litigate spurious counterclaims and have raised growing concern about the criminalization of contractual disputes.",29,INDONESIA
Export Restrictions,"Indonesia’s 2009 Mining Law requires companies to process ore locally before shipping it abroad. Implementing regulations of this law ban the export of over 200 types of mineral ore, including nickel and bauxite. Under Government Regulation 1/2017, companies with existing contracts of work are required to convert to special mining business licenses, divest 51 percent of their shares to Indonesian parties over a period of 10 years, and build a domestic smelter by January 2022, in order to obtain a license to export mineral concentrates. U.S. stakeholders have expressed serious concern about these measures. As part of implementation of the 2009 Mining Law, Indonesia prohibits the export of nickel ore, one of several recent measures restricting the export of key steelmaking raw materials. The United States has expressed concern about the impact this measure will have on global nickel supply and prices, in addition the impact on the production and exportation of stainless steel, which Indonesia is producing in rapidly increasing volumes well in excess of its domestic consumption. On December 11, 2019, the United States requested to join consultations initiated by the European Union concerning the consistency of Indonesia’s export ban with Indonesia’s WTO obligations. In the oil and gas sector, MEMR Regulation 42/2018 requires all oil and gas contractors to sell their production to state-owned Pertamina in an attempt to reduce Pertamina’s crude oil imports. The move comes on top of production-sharing contracts in Indonesia (and the gross split contracts that are replacing them), which contain a standard clause specifying that 25 percent of all production must be sold to domestic refineries for domestic consumption. The policy, known as the Domestic Market Obligation, also requires companies to sell the crude oil to domestic refineries at a heavily discounted rate. BI Regulation 13/2011 (as amended by BI Regulation 14/2012) subjects export earnings to Indonesian banking law and regulations, despite production-sharing contracts that allow companies to remit such earnings abroad. Indonesia imposes a progressive export tax on exports of cocoa and palm oil, which are calculated based on a monthly average of export prices. Although these taxes do not apply below a certain price threshold, there remains a standing levy of $50 per metric ton for crude palm oil and $30 per metric ton for processed palm oil. Indonesia also effectively bans the export of steel scrap and bans exports of raw and semi- processed rattan.",29,INDONESIA

In the mobile technology sector, MCIT Regulation 27/2015 requires all 4G-LTE enabled devices to contain 30 percent local content and all 4G-LTE base stations to contain 40 percent local content. MOI Regulation 29/2017 provides a formula for calculating “local content.” MCIT Circular Letter 518/2017 clarifies that MCIT Regulation 27/2015 applies only to base stations, cell phones, tablets, laptops, and Wi-Fi modems. In the telecommunications sector, MCIT Regulations 7/2009 and 19/2011 require that equipment used in certain wireless broadband services contain local content of at least 30 percent for subscriber stations and 40 percent for base stations and that all wireless equipment contains 50 percent local content.

While Israel has eliminated tariffs on non-agricultural goods as agreed, tariff and non-tariff barriers continue to affect a significant number of key U.S. agricultural product exports. To address the differing views between the two countries over how the FTA applies to trade in agricultural products, in 1996, the United States and Israel signed an Agreement on Trade in Agricultural Products (ATAP), which established a program of gradual and steady market access liberalization for food and agricultural products effective through December 31, 2001. The two parties completed negotiation and implementation of a successor ATAP in 2004. Originally scheduled to last through December 31, 2008, the 2004 ATAP granted improved access for select U.S. agricultural products. The second ATAP has been extended 13 times, most recently through December 31, 2021, to allow time for the negotiation of a successor agreement. The current ATAP provides U.S. food and agricultural products access to the Israeli market under one of three different categories: unlimited duty-free access, duty-free tariff-rate quotas (TRQs), or preferential tariffs, which are set at least 10 percent below Israel’s Most-Favored Nation (MFN) rates.

TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE,"Israeli regulatory bodies, including the Ministry of Economy (Standards Institute of Israel), Ministry of Health (Food Control Services), and the Ministry of Agriculture (Veterinary Services and the Plant Protection Service), often adopt standards developed by Israeli regulators or European standards organizations rather than international standards. This results in the exclusion of some U.S. products from the Israeli market and adds costs to certain U.S. exports to Israel. The Standards Institute of Israel (SII) refuses to accept test results from U.S. toy manufacturers’ accredited in-house labs. SII charges these manufacturers EUR 700 (approximately $850) in testing fees per stock keeping unit for testing their products. By contrast, SII charges EUR 50 (approximately $61) in test-review fees when the manufacturer uses an SII-recognized laboratory. Many U.S. toy manufacturers’ in-house labs are accredited by the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) and are also accredited according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act, which establishes the conditions of a “firewall” lab (i.e., a lab that is owned, managed, or controlled by the manufacturer) to ensure there is no conflict of interest.",30,ISRAEL

An effective mechanism for the early resolution of such disputes promotes transparency and predictability for stakeholders and the public. The United States has urged Japan to adopt measures to protect against piracy in the digital environment. In June 2020, amendments to the Copyright Act expanded the scope of illegal downloads covered by the Act, which was previously limited to copyrighted music and videos, to include all copyrighted material, including manga (comics), books, news articles, and illustrations. The revised Act also regulates “leech websites” (link sites) that use hyperlinks to download torrent files of pirated materials. The ban on illegal downloading took effect on January 1, 2021. In order to be protected as geographical indication (GI) products in Japan under the Act for Protection of Designated Agricultural, Forestry and Fishery Products and Foodstuff (GI Act), domestic as well as foreign GIs are subject to an application process via MAFF for food and via the National Tax Agency (NTA) for alcoholic beverages. As of February 2021, 104 GIs for agricultural, forestry, and fishery products were recognized by MAFF, and 14 GIs for domestic alcoholic beverages were recognized by the NTA. In 2018, the Diet passed revisions to the GI Act that would limit the continued use of protected terms by third parties to a period of up to seven years. Through the Japan–European Union (EU) Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA), which went into effect on February 1, 2019, Japan agreed to protect an additional 210 identified GIs, including 71 agricultural and fishery products and 139 wines, spirits, and other alcoholic beverages. On February 1, 2021, Japan agreed to protect an additional 28 GIs from the European Union. The NTA had already protected seven other identified GIs for alcoholic beverages from Chile, Mexico, and Peru, in light of Japan’s EPAs with those countries. The EPA-related agreements on GI designations, essentially a mutual recognition of specified GIs, comprise a separate process from the MAFF/NTA application process. In total, through the MAFF/NTA process and the process under Japan’s EPA agreements, Japan protects 363 GIs. The United States continues to monitor implementation of Japan’s GI system, as well as implementation of its recent agreements with the EU and other trading partners with respect to GIs. The United States urges Japan to refrain from measures that would unfairly limit market access for U.S. products and to ensure consistency with core transparency and due process principles, in particular with respect to the protection of existing trademarks, the safeguarding of the use of generic terms, and the effective operation of objection and cancellation procedures.

Renewable Energy Services,"U.S. companies attempting to sell renewable energy in Japan have reported being denied grid access because the grid is “full.” Despite revisions to the Electricity Business Act implemented in April 2020 that required the legal unbundling of the transmission and distribution business from the power generation and retail business, legacy utility companies still own and operate most of the transmission and distribution grids in Japan through wholly owned subsidiaries. These utility companies reportedly overstate actual grid usage and understate available capacity to prevent competition from new entrants. In addition, Japan’s technical and safety standards do not always reflect international standards, and complicated codes and slow approval processes for new energy technology benefit incumbents. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) enforces the laws and regulations that apply to renewable energy in Japan and regularly reviews and revises related rules to account for market factors. In September 2020, METI proposed new changes to the feed-in tariff (FIT) mechanism that obliges electricity retailers to purchase electricity generated from biomass, geothermal, and wind renewable energy sources at fixed prices for certain periods determined by the Japanese Government. The changes will lower prices accepted under the FIT scheme unless companies meet certain conditions, including a deadline for previously approved FIT projects to become operational. In response to public comments and U.S. Government engagement, METI announced in November 2020 its intention to extend deadlines for projects that have experienced environmental review delays. In addition, METI is currently discussing the details of a new “feed-in premium” (FIP) scheme that will be phased in starting in early 2022 as an eventual replacement for the existing FIT mechanism. Under the new FIP mechanism, certain renewable generators are eligible to sell power into the spot market at a premium to the wholesale price, rather than receive a fixed price per kilowatt-hour under the current FIT system. The United States will continue to monitor these developments.",31,JAPAN
BARRIERS TO DIGITAL TRADE AND ELECTRONIC COMMERCE,Privacy Regulation,31,JAPAN
Privacy Regulation,"The Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI), enacted in 2003, is Japan’s principal data protection legislation. Following several revisions, the APPI took full effect in 2017, and all private enterprises handling the personal information of individuals in Japan are required to conform to this law. Japan acceded to the APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules (CBPR) system in 2014. In 2019, Japan and the EU mutually recognized each other’s data protection laws as providing an adequate level of protection of personal data, allowing personal data to flow freely between the two jurisdictions. As part of the agreement, Japan put in place additional requirements regarding EU data, including supplementary rules restricting the transfer of EU data from Japan to a third country, including to the United States. The APPI was amended to better align with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation and was further strengthened by amendments that the Diet passed in June 2020. The Personal Information Protection Commission (PPC) was established in 2016 as Japan’s centralized data protection authority with enforcement powers backed by penal sanctions. Despite this authority, U.S. industry has expressed concern that other Japanese Government agencies have created parallel data privacy and protection rules that encroach on PPC’s jurisdiction, complicating compliance.",31,JAPAN
Digital Platform Regulation,"In September 2019, a new advisory board, the Digital Market Competition Headquarters (DMCH), was created under the Cabinet Secretariat to lead the coordination of competition policy in the digital market. U.S. companies have expressed concern that, as larger players in the market, they would be targeted and FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 301 subjected to cumbersome regulations not applicable to smaller information technology companies with the same practices and that additional regulations and scrutiny based solely on the digital character of a business may not be justified. In May 2020, the Diet passed a new law developed by the DMCH on “Improving Transparency and Fairness of Specified Digital Platforms,” which obliges certain platform operators to improve transparency in their business practices. The law raises concern because it indicates that the regulations will only apply to digital companies “larger than a certain size…in areas that are particularly important parts of society” and “for which the state of transactions has been clearly ascertained through surveys,” giving the Japanese Government wide discretion to pick and choose which specific companies will be affected. The Japanese Government initially targeted major online shopping mall operators and app stores in the regulations that went into effect in February 2021. Persistent official references to “GAFA companies” (Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon) in the announcement of this new law, while excluding references to Japanese or other foreign companies with similar business practices and market share in Japan, suggest a disproportionate focus on U.S. companies. The law also raises concern because it contains a requirement that companies explain how their search rankings are determined, which if not carefully implemented and enforced could have the unintended consequence of facilitating the artificial manipulation of rankings to the detriment of consumers. On June 17, 2020, the DMCH issued an Interim Report on the Digital Advertisement Market for public comment, signaling that these platform operations may be brought into the scope of the law. U.S. stakeholders have expressed concern that several conclusions put forward in the DMCH’s interim report are not warranted and say that decision-making is opaque because U.S. stakeholders are excluded from important DMCH discussions and meeting minutes are not published. The DMCH will publish a final report in March 2021. Meanwhile, the JFTC issued its own report on the digital advertising market on February 17, 2021, citing Google’s “monopolistic and oligopolistic” position and warning that certain behaviors of digital platform operators may constitute an abuse of superior bargaining position prohibited under anti-monopoly law. The United States has been extensively engaging with Japan regarding these and other concerns and will continue to monitor implementation of the legislation. In a related action, in 2019, Japan’s Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) released guidelines on applying the Antimonopoly Act (AMA) to transactions between digital platform operators and consumers, charting new territory for regulating the digital market in Japan. In its “Guidelines Concerning Abuse of a Superior Bargaining Position in Transactions between Digital Platform Owners and Consumers that Provide Personal Information, etc.” (ASBP Platform Guidelines), JFTC asserts that platform companies are in “a superior bargaining position” (a provision under the AMA) when customers have no choice but to provide their data to use the services and may commit an “abuse” of that position when use of personal data is not fully and accurately disclosed or protected. The United States does not view enforcement of the “abuse of a superior bargaining position” provision (ASBP) under the AMA as an appropriate mechanism to implement these consumer protections, which are more appropriately addressed through privacy and data protection safeguards—regardless of the bargaining position of the parties involved. After receiving input from stakeholders, JFTC provided several examples in the final guidelines of practices that would or would not constitute ASBP. However, the guidelines potentially cover a wide range of conduct that is not described in the examples, leaving businesses without sufficient guidance on how to comply with the law. Imposing conditions on a consumer’s ability to access a service is a common business practice in many, if not most, sectors. U.S. stakeholders have also noted concerns with amendments to Japan’s Telecommunications Business Act (TBA), which the Diet passed in June 2020.

INVESTMENT BARRIERS,"Japan continues to have the lowest inward foreign direct investment (FDI) as a proportion of total output of any major Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) country. According to OECD statistics, the inward FDI stock at the end of 2019 (latest data available) was the equivalent of only 4.3 percent of Japan’s GDP. Inward foreign merger and acquisition (M&A) activity, which accounts for a large portion of FDI in other OECD countries, also lags in Japan. While the Japanese Government recognizes the importance of FDI to revitalizing the country’s economy, its performance in implementing domestic regulatory reforms to encourage a sustained increase in FDI has been uneven. In June 2013, the Japanese Government announced its goal of doubling Japan’s inward 2012 year-end FDI stock to ¥35 trillion ($318 billion) by 2020, and it confirmed this commitment in its 2018 growth strategy. At the end of 2019, Japan’s inward FDI stock was ¥33.9 trillion ($310.3 billion), an increase of 10.4 percent over the previous year. The Japanese Government pursued a range of policies intended to promote its 2020 target. However, the number of annual inbound M&A deals has remained relatively low for an economy the size of Japan’s, raising questions about the effectiveness of these policies in promoting FDI. A variety of factors make inbound M&A difficult in Japan, including attitudes toward outside investors, unfinished corporate governance reforms, cross-shareholdings, aspects of Japan’s commercial law regime, and a relative lack of financial transparency and disclosure.

Improving Anti-Monopoly Act Compliance and Deterrence,"Japan’s Anti-Monopoly Act (AMA) provides for both administrative and criminal sanctions against cartels and administrative sanctions for non-cartel anticompetitive conduct. Criminal prosecutions, which have the strongest deterrent effect against anticompetitive behavior in other countries, have been few, and penalties against convicted company officials have been weak, although the JFTC has routinely imposed sizable civil “surcharges” against cartelists. The United States has continued to urge Japan to take steps to maximize the effectiveness of enforcement against cartel and bid rigging violations of the AMA to ensure open and competitive markets.

This concern has intensified with the release of the ASBP Platform Guidelines in 2019, extending application of ASBP to transactions between digital platform operators and consumers. Stakeholders have called for further clarification of each of the forms of abuse listed in the ASBP Platform Guidelines to minimize the substantial uncertainty for companies and users.",31,JAPAN

The U.S. market share of medical devices increases to 60 percent if local FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 305 production in Japan by U.S. companies is included. Additional ministry figures show that imports of U.S. pharmaceuticals were valued at $5.1 billion and comprised five percent of the overall Japanese market in 2019 (latest data available). The total market share of U.S.-origin pharmaceuticals in Japan is estimated to be approximately 20 percent if local production by U.S. firms and compounds licensed to Japanese manufacturers is included. Over the last decade, the Japanese Government has increased the appeal of Japan’s pharmaceutical and medical device markets by reducing regulatory approval timelines and by improving the predictability of the reimbursement pricing system. However, reimbursement pricing changes from 2018 onward have eroded this progress. In the 2018 pricing cycle, Japan made several changes to its Price Maintenance Premium (PMP) rule, which was originally put into place in 2011 to reward innovation and allow for pricing stability throughout the patent life of a medicine.

However, many significant market access barriers remained as of 2020, including a 12.5 percent tariff on vitamin imports. The CAA’s Food with Functional Claims (FFC) is a third food-related category under the Food with Health Claims system, parallel to two other premarket government approval systems, Foods for Specified Health Uses (FOSHU) and Foods with Nutrient Function Claims (FNFC). These processes apply to both imported and domestic products. Producers of most nutritional supplements are generally unable to obtain either FOSHU approval or FNFC designation due to FOSHU’s costly and time-consuming approval process and FNFC’s standards and specifications, which limit the range of nutritional ingredients such as vitamins and minerals that can qualify for FNFC. Vitamin and mineral products designated under the FNFC system are excluded from the FFC system.

Top U.S. exports include skincare, haircare, makeup preparations, fragrance, and toiletry goods such as pre- and after-shaving products, oral care, and bath preparations. Delays in updates to market authorization requirements for “quasi-drugs,” which include cosmetics products that are generally classified as over-the-counter drugs in the United States, as well as delays in the adoption of an online system, are among the barriers to the continued growth of U.S. exports. Although there have been some improvements in processing time, the adoption of a monograph system, intended to expedite the registration of products as quasi-drugs under Japan’s Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Act, continues to be delayed. As a result, products that contain active ingredients that are approved for specific uses in Japan, such as in anti-dandruff shampoos and skin care, may require six months to receive market approval.

GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT,"Since May 2015, an initiative dubbed “Buy Kenyan Build Kenya” has required Kenyan state ministries, departments, and agencies to procure at least 40 percent of their supplies locally. For example, government entities are required to give an exclusive procurement preference to motor vehicles and motorcycles produced by companies that have assembly plants in Kenya. The Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act (PPADA) of 2016 reserves procurement preferences for Kenyan-owned firms and goods manufactured or mined in Kenya. For tenders funded entirely by the government with a value of less than Ksh 50 million (approximately $487,000), the preference for Kenyan firms and goods is exclusive. Where the procuring entity seeks to contract with non-Kenyan firms or procure foreign goods, the PPADA requires a report detailing evidence of an inability to procure locally. The PPADA calls for at least 30 percent of government procurement contracts to go to firms owned by women, youth, and persons with disabilities. The PPADA further reserves 20 percent of procurement contracts tendered at the county level for residents of that county.

BARRIERS TO DIGITAL TRADE,Data Localization Requirements,33,KENYA
Data Localization Requirements,"Kenya’s November 2019 Data Protection Act (DPA) includes unclear and potentially restrictive provisions governing the cross-border transfer of personal information. The DPA requires that data controllers provide “proof” that personal data will be secure as a condition for transferring the data outside Kenya, but does not describe what would constitute proof. The DPA also requires consent of the data subject as a condition for the cross-border transfer of any “sensitive personal data,” a broad category of information. Such conditions may prove burdensome for firms that supply services on a cross-border basis or depend on data processing systems located abroad. Additionally, the Act empowers a political official to prohibit the cross-border transfer of certain categories of data, creating uncertainty for businesses operating in Kenya that depend on cross-border data flows. Regulations implementing these provisions have yet to be released, nor has a political official, who would need to be confirmed by Kenya’s National Assembly, been selected.",33,KENYA
Internet Services,"The Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act (the Act) was signed in May 2018, though certain key provisions of the Act were initially suspended by Kenya’s judiciary, pending review of a petition challenging the constitutionality and legality of those provisions. Some of the initially suspended provisions of the Act could limit online access to information and curtail the creation of user-generated content, potentially limiting the ability of some service providers to operate profitably in Kenya. In February 2020, Kenya’s High Court dismissed the challenges, ruling that the Act complied with Kenya’s constitution, and lifted the suspension. While implementing regulations have yet to be issued, companies are required to comply with the Act’s cybersecurity measures, and can be held liable for the publication of content deemed to be factually incorrect. In August 2020, Kenya published the November 2019 National Information, Communications, and Technology (ICT) Policy, which updates a 2006 policy. While this ICT Policy is intended to facilitate universal access to ICT infrastructure and services, some provisions establish potential barriers to digital trade, including a local equity requirement that mandates that firms providing ICT services must have at least 30 percent Kenyan ownership, as well as preferences and incentives for Kenyan-owned ICT",33,KENYA
INVESTMENT BARRIERS,Limitations on Foreign Equity Participation,33,KENYA
Limitations on Foreign Equity Participation,"Kenya imposes foreign ownership limitations in several sectors, often in combination with local content requirements. For example, the Communications Authority, Kenya’s telecommunications regulator, requires 30 percent Kenyan shareholding within three years of receiving a license. The 2016 Private Security Regulation Act restricts foreign participation in the private security sector by requiring that Kenyans hold at least 25 percent of shares in private security firms. The 2010 Kenya Insurance Act restricts foreign capital investment to two thirds, with no single person controlling more than 25 percent of an insurer’s capital. Additionally, since 2015, Kenya has imposed regulations requiring that Kenyans own at least 15 percent of the share capital of derivatives exchanges. The Nairobi Securities Exchange does not have foreign ownership restrictions and listed companies can be 100 percent foreign owned. The 2016 Mining Act imposes a variety of restrictions on foreign participation in the mining sector. Among other restrictions, the Mining Act reserves acquisition of mineral rights for Kenyan companies; requires 60 percent Kenyan ownership of both mineral dealerships and artisanal mining companies; and requires large- scale mining operations to offer 20 percent equity on the Nairobi Securities Exchange within three years of commencing operations, while also offering 10 percent “free-carried interest” (free equity stake in capital operations) to the Kenyan Government. The 2011 National Construction Authority Act (NCAA) imposes local content restrictions on “foreign contractors,” defined as companies incorporated outside Kenya or with more than 50 percent ownership by non-Kenyan citizens. The NCAA also contains provisions requiring foreign contractors to hire from the local labor market, unless the National Construction Authority determines the necessary technical skills are unavailable locally. In addition, the NCAA requires foreign contractors to enter into subcontracts or joint ventures assuring that at least 30 percent of the contract work is done by local firms.",33,KENYA
Local Content Requirements,"When making initial investments, foreign investors with foreign staff are required to submit plans for the gradual phasing out of non-Kenyan employees. In considering an application for investment, the Kenya Investment Authority reviews the extent to which such investment or activity will contribute to employment creation, acquisition of new skills or technology, and government revenues. In November 2018, the Kenyan Senate passed the Local Content Bill applicable to the oil and gas and other extractive sectors. The bill, which has been forwarded to the National Assembly for final approval, would require enterprises applying for licenses and project permits to submit a “local content plan” that sets forth specific actions the enterprise will take to give “first priority” to locally produced goods and services, employ the local workforce, and develop local employment skills. The plan also must include a local research and development plan, a plan for transferring technology to Kenyan firms, and a plan for replacing non-Kenyan employees with Kenyan employees over time. The bill further requires the Kenyan Government to “encourage” joint ventures with local firms. The proposed bill gives the Cabinet Secretaries responsible for the extractive sectors a mandate to review and reject applicants’ local content plans and to prescribe regulations specifying minimum levels of local content. U.S. business associations have raised concerns over the bill, pointing to its lack of clarity, its overlap with the 2016 Mining Act, and whether it is consistent with regard to Kenya’s WTO obligations. The United States also has raised concerns with Kenya. As of early 2021, the National Assembly had not yet addressed the bill because of an error in the procedure by which it was introduced, but the bill is subject to re-introduction at any time. 320 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS",33,KENYA
State Enterprises,"According to Kenya’s most recent notification to the WTO in 2006, Kenya does not have any state-trading enterprises. However, as of 2013 (latest data available), there were approximately 262 state corporations operating in various sectors of the economy. According to the WTO Secretariat, each state corporation is under oversight of a line ministry, which is responsible for ensuring its proper management. Kenya has been slow to open public infrastructure to competition because the Government considers state- owned companies that control infrastructure to be “strategic” enterprises. As a result, reform and partial privatization of the telecommunications, power, and rail sectors are progressing slowly. For example, the Government of Kenya wholly owns the National Oil Corporation and the Kenya Pipeline Corporation, and limits competition with these companies. Other state enterprises, including Kenya Electricity Generating Company, Kenya Electricity Transmission Company, Kenya Power and Lighting Company (KPLC), and the Geothermal Development Company, dominate the electricity generation, transmission, and distribution segments of the energy sector. KPLC’s internal procurement rules require that 80 percent of supplies be sourced from Kenyan-registered companies to encourage foreign suppliers to establish manufacturing facilities in the country. Certain state parastatals have enjoyed preferential access to markets. Examples include Kenya Re, which enjoys a guaranteed market share; Kenya Seed Company, which has fewer marketing barriers than its foreign competitors do; and the National Oil Corporation, which benefits from retail market outlets developed with government funds. Some state enterprises have also benefitted from easier access to government guarantees, subsidies, or credit at favorable interest rates.",33,KENYA
Land,"The 2010 Kenyan Constitution prohibits foreigners from holding freehold land title anywhere in the country, permitting only leasehold titles of up to 99 years. The cumbersome and opaque process required to acquire land raises concerns about security of title, particularly given past abuses relating to the distribution and redistribution of public land. Complicated land transactions procedures, lack of adequate urban planning, and under-investment in land demarcation expose investors to the risk of receiving fake title deeds or finding a plot with multiple titles and unauthorized sales. Clear titles are unavailable for an estimated two-thirds of Kenyan land. The 2016 Community Land Bill made it easier for communities to claim title over their ancestral land and receive documentation. The 2019 Land Index (amendment) bill guides compensation for land compulsorily acquired for use in government projects. The value of compensation is based on market rates and tax returns for the land in question, data that is often non-existent for most community land. This could present problems in the pastoralist-dominated regions of northern Kenya where large projects, including the Lamu Port South FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 321 Sudan and Ethiopia Transport Corridor, would need to be built on community land that may lack the necessary data to determine the value of compensation.",33,KENYA
OTHER BARRIERS,Bribery and Corruption,33,KENYA
Bribery and Corruption,"Corruption remains a substantial barrier to doing business in Kenya. U.S. firms continue to report they find it difficult to succeed against competitors willing to ignore legal standards or engage in bribery and other forms of corruption. Corruption is widely reported to affect government procurement tender processes at both the national and county level. The Government has not implemented anticorruption laws effectively. U.S. firms routinely report direct requests for bribes from all levels of the Kenyan Government. In January 2020, Kenya began an anticorruption campaign using the Ethics and Anticorruption Commission (EACC) and Office of the Director of Public Prosecution to open cases against high profile offenders. While some cases have brought to light by the EACC have resulted in convictions, no high-profile cases have resulted in conviction. Despite efforts to increase efficiency and public confidence in the judiciary, a backlog of cases and continuing corruption reduce the credibility and effectiveness of Kenya’s judicial system. While judicial reforms are moving forward, bribes, extortion, and political considerations continue to influence outcomes in court cases. An Employment and Labor Relations Court exists in Kenya, but it is plagued by long delays in rendering judgments. As such, foreign and local investors risk lengthy and costly legal procedures.",33,KENYA
Export Barriers,"Under the 2014 Scrap Metal Act, Kenya restricts the export of any form of scrap metal absent authorization by the Ministry of Industry, Trade, and Cooperatives (MoITC) in order to discourage vandalism of infrastructure and to encourage domestic manufacturing that uses scrap metal as an input. An export levy of 20 percent on the approved export of copper waste and scrap metal encourages local smelting, enhances the value of local copper waste, and discourages black market export of copper cables and wires. The 2013 Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Authority Act prohibits exports of raw agricultural produce such as macadamia nuts, bixa orellana, cashew nuts, and pyrethrum without express authorization from the Kenyan Cabinet Secretary for Industry, Trade, and Cooperatives. 322 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS",33,KENYA

IMPORT POLICIES,Tariffs,34,KOREA
Tariffs,"Under KORUS, Korea has now eliminated tariffs on nearly all U.S. industrial goods exports. Tariffs continue to be phased out for certain seafood products. Korea has eliminated tariffs on the majority of U.S. agricultural products, while maintaining tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) on a handful of U.S. food exports. To increase the competitiveness of the domestic agricultural and livestock industries, in 2018 Korea voluntarily announced duty-free Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) TRQs for the feed grain complex, made up of 18 commodities including corn, soymeal, barley, and oats. Rice is excluded from Korea's tariff commitments under KORUS, and under the WTO Agreement on Agriculture, Korea benefitted from special treatment that enabled it to control imports of rice with quotas that increased between 1995 and 2004. In 2004, Korea negotiated a 10-year extension of this special treatment with other WTO members, subject to a Minimum Market Access (MMA) agreement. At the end of the MMA agreement, Korea chose to “tariffy” its import regime for rice rather than to seek another FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 323 extension of special treatment. Negotiations with the United States, Australia, China, Thailand and Vietnam resulted in a Plurilateral Agreement completed in December 2020, which provides the United States with a country-specific quota of 132,304 metric tons, with a five percent in-quota tariff and 513 percent over-quota tariff.",34,KOREA

INVESTMENT BARRIERS,"Laos has a challenging investment climate due to concerns about corruption, difficulties in enforcing contracts, an underdeveloped judicial system, overlapping and often contradictory regulations, and limited access to financial services. Domestic ownership and partnership requirements vary by industry, and administrative processes for obtaining investment licenses are often inconsistent or inefficient. Laos requires an annually renewable business license, receipt of which is contingent on a certification that all taxes have been paid. However, the Lao Government often assesses taxes in an unpredictable manner. In February 2018, Prime Minister Thongloun Sisoulith issued an order laying out specific steps for various ministries to take in order to improve the business environment, some of which have resulted in measurable improvements including decreasing the time required to obtain a business license. Nonetheless, broad reforms aimed at improving the business environment have been largely unsuccessful.",36,LAOS

GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT,"On December 1, 2018, Mexico announced plans to centralize almost all federal government procurement under the Secretariat of Finance, with the goal of curbing corruption, reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies, and achieving lower prices through consolidated purchasing. The state-operated oil company, Pemex, and the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) were exempted from the centralization due to their designations as “productive companies of the state.” The Mexican armed forces were also exempted, on national security grounds. The Secretariat of Finance announced June 28, 2019, that 61.2 percent of bids for medicine and medical supplies destined for government and public hospitals and clinics via the Secretariat of Health and Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) either did not receive bids or Hacienda considered the bids invalid. U.S. exporters expressed concern the procurement process was less transparent than in previous years and did not provide adequate preparation time. U.S. companies expressed similar concerns that the 2020 procurement cycle did not have adequate preparation time and there were multiple uncoordinated tenders announced. In addition, for certain construction projects there has been an increase in direct awards for government contracts. In August 2020, the Mexican Congress approved an amendment to Article 1 of Mexico’s procurement law to allow direct procurement of pharmaceutical products and medical devices, including from international institutions such as UNOPS. In late 2020, Mexico began large procurements of medicines directly from UNOPS.

Television programmers have long been allowed to follow the industry practice of inserting up to 12 minutes per hour for advertising without exceeding 144 minutes per day, a practice upheld by Mexico’s court in 2015 as consistent with Mexico’s statutes. In February 2020, IFT published an opinion at odds with the 2015 court decision and long-standing practice. As IFT did not go through standard regulatory rulemaking, the intent and legal effect of the opinion is unclear, and it has created uncertainty in the market that disproportionately affects U.S. stakeholders. IFT should resolve this issue by affirming the legality of existing practices, consistent with the 2015 court decision. Mexico prohibited foreign investment in its broadcasting sector until the 2014 telecommunications reform allowed for up to 49 percent foreign equity in Mexican broadcasting enterprises. However, actual investment is limited to the share permitted for Mexican broadcasting investment in the company’s country of origin. To enhance competition, Televisa was declared a “preponderant agent” in the free-to-air television broadcasting market and is therefore subject to tougher regulation, including the requirement to share its broadcasting infrastructure with competitors.

Morocco’s cumbersome tax and employment regimes and property registration procedures also continue to impede business. In an effort to avoid an excessive drain on foreign exchange, Moroccan authorities allow Moroccan companies to prepay only 30 percent of a shipment’s total value in advance of import. These Moroccan restrictions on purchasers that need, or would like, to prepay orders of imported merchandise are often problematic for U.S. exporters that require 100 percent advance payment.

Limitations on Foreign Equity Participation,"In June 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the New Zealand Overseas Investment Office (OIO) implemented a temporary emergency notification regime (ENR) requiring notification of certain foreign investments in New Zealand businesses, including those not generally subject to screening under the New Zealand foreign direct investment regime. The OIO and ministers assess whether the transaction is contrary to the “national interest,” a test that assesses risks to national security. The ENR will remain in place while the New Zealand economy is still affected by COVID-19. The New Zealand Government will review it every 90 days. Upon expiry of the ENR, New Zealand is anticipated to introduce a “call-in power” for strategically important businesses (SIBs), which include critical infrastructure such as telecoms, ports, airports, and dual use/military related sensitive technology, as well as media. SIBs will be subject to investment screening irrespective of the investment size or the stake being acquired (with limited exceptions). For non-SIBs following the expiry of the ENR, New Zealand is anticipated to revert to screening any foreign investment that would result in the acquisition of 25 percent or more of ownership in, or of a controlling interest in, “significant business assets,” which are defined as assets valued at more than NZ$100 million (approximately $69 million). This threshold is higher—NZ$200 million (approximately $137 million)— for non-government investors from countries that have entered into trade agreements with New Zealand. These investments, however, are still subject to the national interest test. Additionally, the OIO screens any foreign investment that would result in the acquisition of 25 percent or more of a fishing quota either directly or through the acquisition of a company that already possesses a quota. The OIO also reviews the acquisition of land defined as “sensitive” by the Overseas Investment Act (OIA), which includes farmland greater than five hectares, land adjoining the foreshore, and conservation land. In August 2018, the government amended the OIA to expand the definition of “sensitive land” to include existing residential real estate.",40,NEW ZEALAND

Technical Barriers to Trade,"U.S. industry has raised concerns that food product registration in Nicaragua can be complicated and arbitrary. The Ministry of Health requires a Certificate of Free Sale for product registration. In some cases, U.S. companies have satisfied the requirement by submitting documents from state or local government authorities or trade organizations. However, U.S. manufacturers cannot gain approval to sell into the Nicaraguan market if they are unable to obtain such documents. U.S. food companies have expressed concern regarding Law 842 (2013), which requires that all processed food products be marked with an expiration date. Nicaraguan officials have at times interpreted “Best By” dates as expiration dates and have destroyed products exceeding those dates, even when the product was for re-export. Nicaraguan importers of U.S. products have complained that the law imposes costs on food importers, especially for products that do not typically have expiration dates.

SUBSIDIES,"Albanisa, the joint venture of the Venezuelan and Nicaraguan state oil companies that previously imported FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 375 and distributed Venezuelan petroleum, provided preferential financing to parties that agreed to export their products to Venezuela. Albanisa’s business practices were found to have enriched corrupt officials of the Nicaraguan Government, and were blocked by operation of law following the January 28, 2019 U.S. designation of Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A., for sanctions. Albanisa’s subsidiary, Banco Corporativo SA, was designated for sanctions on April 17, 2019. CARUNA, the savings and credit cooperative that held Albanisa funds, was designated for sanctions on October 9, 2020. Albanisa is reportedly involved with many other businesses in Nicaragua, including in the energy sector. Fuel distributor Distribuidor Nicaraguense de Petroleo S.A. (DNP) was designated for sanctions on December 12, 2019 because members of the Ortega family had used it to enrichment themselves through non-competitive contracts with Nicaraguan Government institutions. Power plants owned by Albanisa receive the most generous guaranteed “installed capacity” payments from the government, which is paid regardless of whether the plants generate any electricity. In fact, two Albanisa plants still collect over $3 million per month, despite generating barely any electricity following sanctions. All exporters receive tax benefit certificates equivalent to 1.5 percent of the free-on-board value of exported goods. Under the CAFTA–DR, Nicaragua may not adopt new duty waivers or expand existing duty waivers that are conditioned on the fulfillment of a performance requirement (e.g., the export of a given level or percentage of goods). However, Nicaragua may maintain such duty waiver measures for such time as it remains an Annex VII country developing country for the purposes of the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures.

GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT,"In practice, there are significant practical hurdles that inhibit the ability of U.S. suppliers to compete for sales to Nicaraguan Government entities. Existing law provides that all government purchases must be planned and approved by procurement committees within each public entity, and published in Annual Procurement Plans. The law also requires a minimum of 30 days from publication of a bid to the deadline for submissions. However, these requirements are not always followed. Terms of Reference and technical specifications are frequently unclear. Requirements for financial guarantees and local legal representation create significant challenges for U.S. firms without a local presence or partner. Weak rule of law and the ability of outside actors to influence the judicial process hamper due process. The Government of Nicaragua is not reliably responsive to foreign governments raising these issues. The United States will continue to monitor Nicaragua’s government procurement practices to ensure that they are applied in a manner consistent with CAFTA–DR obligations.

The United States also continues to hear allegations that Nicaraguan Government entities are not responsive, and in some cases may be complicit in urging property rights violations against legitimate property owners for political reasons. Some property owners say they have had to pay violators to regain possession. In addition, investors continue to raise concerns with Law 840 (2013), which specifies that property holders whose land is expropriated or nationalized will receive compensation based on cadastral value (the tax- assessed value of a property established by the national government) rather than on the value determined by the market.

Bribery and Corruption,"U.S. stakeholder have expressed concerns that corruption in the Nicaraguan Government, including in the judiciary, continues to constrain successful investment in Nicaragua. Administrative and judicial decision- FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 377 making is widely believed to be inconsistent, nontransparent, and time-consuming. Extra-judicial interests, in particular political interests, influence administrative and judicial processes. Courts frequently grant orders, called amparos, that suspend official investigatory and enforcement actions indefinitely, delays that appear intended to protect individuals suspected of white-collar crime. In 2020, independent media published various reports of courts improperly issuing arrest and seizure warrants based on reportedly groundless government tax actions, including against press outlets that have been critical of the government. The CAFTA–DR contains strong public sector anti-bribery commitments and anti-corruption measures in government contracting, and U.S. firms are guaranteed a fair and transparent process to sell goods and services to a wide range of government entities. Investors have raised concerns that regulatory authorities are slow to apply existing laws, act arbitrarily, and often favor one competitor over another. Foreign investors report that government officials significantly delay issuance of residency permits, as a means to elicit bribes, requiring frequent travel out of the country for investors to renew visas. U.S. traders have reported cases of customs officials reviewing social media posts and other information for evidence of anti-government rhetoric. Investors continue to express concern about arbitrariness in taxation procedures, as well as the frequency and duration of tax audits of foreign investors. The costs of these barriers vary and the Nicaraguan Government is not historically responsive to U.S. Government efforts to address them. In addition to tax-related seizures, multiple companies and individuals have reported attempts by others to seize or occupy their land. These reports assert that government institutions such as police, the court system, and attorney general’s office, have either been nonresponsive to attempts to seek redress or actively assisted the seizures.

Tariffs,"Nigeria’s average Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) applied tariff rate was 12.1 percent in 2019 (latest data available). Nigeria’s average MFN applied tariff rate was 15.8 percent for agricultural products and 11.5 percent for non-agricultural products in 2019 (latest data available). Nigeria has bound 20.1 percent of its tariff lines in the World Trade Organization (WTO), with an average WTO bound tariff rate of 120.9 percent. Consistent with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) common external tariff (CET), Nigeria applies five tariff bands: (1) zero percent duty on essential social goods (e.g., medicine); (2) 5 percent duty on essential commodities, raw materials, and capital goods; (3) 10 percent duty on intermediate goods; (4) 20 percent duty on consumer goods; and, (5) 35 percent duty on certain goods that the Nigerian Government elected to afford greater protection. The CET was slated to be fully harmonized by 2020, but in practice some ECOWAS Member States have maintained deviations from the CET beyond the January 1, 2020 deadline. Nigeria maintains a number of supplemental levies and duties on imports of certain goods, which significantly raise the effective tariff rate paid by importers. For example, Nigeria maintains a combined effective duty (tariff plus levy) of 50 percent or more on 156 tariff lines. These include 15 tariff lines on which the combined effective duty exceeds the 70 percent limit set by ECOWAS, covering tobacco (135 percent for cigars and cigarettes and 85 percent for tobacco and other tobacco products), rice (120 percent), wheat flour (100 percent), and sugar (80 percent). In 2013, the Nigerian Government announced an Automotive Industry Development Plan (NAIDP) to expand domestic vehicle manufacturing. The NAIDP imposes a 35 percent levy on automobile imports, which applies in addition to the pre-existing 35 percent tariff, for an effective total duty of 70",42,NIGERIA
Non-Tariff Barriers,"Nigeria uses non-tariff measures in an effort to achieve “self-sufficiency” in certain commodities. For example, in 2015, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) imposed a series of restrictions that prohibited the use of official foreign exchange to import 41 product categories, including rice, meat, poultry, vegetable oil, and a number of steel products. The CBN indicated that this action was meant to protect and support domestic production, and not solely to maintain the value of its currency or preserve foreign exchange reserves. These measures have made it difficult for U.S. businesses to export the covered items to Nigeria and for Nigerian companies to source inputs needed for production. In December 2018, the CBN added fertilizer to the list of covered products and announced that the list could rise to as many as 50 products. In February 2020, the CBN implemented a ban on foreign exchange for milk and dairy products without clarifying guidance regarding implementation. In July 2020, the CBN added maize to the foreign exchange restriction list.

GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT,"The Public Procurement Act of 2007 established the Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP) as the regulatory authority responsible for the monitoring and oversight of public procurement in Nigeria. Nigeria only requires government entities to engage in competitive bidding for any procurement worth more than ₦2.5 million (approximately $6,500). Only majority Nigerian-owned companies may bid on procurements above ₦2.5 million ($6,500), and up to ₦100 million ($260,000) for goods and up to ₦1 billion ($2.6 million) for services and works. Above those thresholds, both majority foreign-owned and majority Nigerian-owned companies may engage in competitive bidding. Nigerian Government agencies do not always follow procurement guidelines, despite the requirement that no procurement proceedings shall be formalized until the procuring entity has ensured that funds are available to meet the obligations and has obtained a “Certificate of ‘No Objection’ to Contract Award” from the BPP. Executive Order 5 of 2018 added restrictions and obligations for public procurement related to science, engineering, and technology. The order is designed to bolster the Public Procurement Act of 2007 and directs government offices to grant preference to indigenous professionals. Upon the release of the order, U.S.-based firms raised concerns that it specifies that the Ministry of Interior “shall desist from giving visa[s] to foreign workers whose skills are readily available in Nigeria.” There is a local content margin of preference, which varies from project to project, but does not exceed 15 percent. In addition, Nigeria offers a preference to majority Nigerian-owned companies as long as their price is within 15 percent of a majority foreign-owned company. Foreign companies may also be subject to a local content or other localization requirement (e.g., partnership with a local partner firm or joining a consortium). U.S. companies have expressed concerns about corruption and lack of transparency in procurement processes. Nigeria has made modest progress on its pledge to conduct open and competitive bidding processes for government procurement. The BPP has made a variety of procurement procedures and bidding information publicly available on its website. Nigeria’s National Assembly operates its own procurement process that has not been subject to BPP oversight and that has lacked transparency. Although U.S. companies have won contracts in a number of sectors, difficulties in receiving payment are common and can discourage firms from bidding. Supplier or foreign government subsidized financing arrangements appear in some cases to be a crucial factor in the award of government procurements. The Guidelines require ministries and development agencies to source and procure all computer hardware only from NITDA-approved OEMs. The Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content Development Act also mandates a maximum quota of five percent of all positions that can be allotted to expatriates and minimum host community requirements among other local content stipulations. Nigeria is neither a Party to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement nor an observer to the WTO",42,NIGERIA
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION,"Nigeria has taken steps toward improving its legal framework for intellectual property (IP) protection. In 2017, Nigeria submitted its instruments of accession and ratification in connection with four World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) treaties: the WIPO Copyright Treaty; the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty; the Beijing Treaty on Audiovisual Performances; and, the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired or Otherwise Print Disabled. Nigeria has not yet amended its national laws to implement the treaties. In 2019, the President signed into law the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Act which, among other things, contains provisions designed to combat trademark counterfeiting. However, pirated and counterfeit goods remain widely available in Nigeria and often threaten the health and safety of consumers. Counterfeit pharmaceuticals, automotive parts, software, music and video recordings, and other consumer goods are prevalent. Also, IP enforcement remains inadequate due to chronically insufficient resources for enforcement agencies, porous borders, entrenched trafficking systems that make enforcement difficult, and corruption. Public awareness is low regarding the importance of IP as a key driver of Nigeria’s economic diversification and of its attractiveness as an investment destination.",42,NIGERIA

BARRIERS TO DIGITAL TRADE,"The NITDA Guidelines noted above require all foreign and domestic businesses to store all data concerning Nigerian citizens in Nigeria. The Guidelines further require that businesses host all government data locally unless officially exempted. These requirements raise costs for foreign businesses seeking to invest in the Nigerian market and create an intractable barrier to market entry for firms that distribute their data storage and processing globally. Further, such data localization requirements prevent Nigerian businesses from taking advantage of cloud computing services supplied on a cross-border basis. The Guidelines also require ICT companies to use Nigerian businesses for the provision of at least 80 percent of all value-added services on their network. The Guidelines define “value-added service” vaguely, creating uncertainty for businesses seeking to comply with the measure. Though Nigeria has largely declined to enforce the Guidelines to date, periodic threats of repercussions for non-compliance remain a concern.",42,NIGERIA
INVESTMENT BARRIERS,"Nigeria’s investment climate continues to be characterized by significant market potential but also by weak government institutions, corruption, regulatory uncertainty, inadequate infrastructure (especially electricity), security challenges, inadequate health care, poor education systems, and inadequate access to finance for small- and medium-sized enterprises and consumers. These barriers impede potential U.S. investment in Nigeria. Investors also must contend with complex tax procedures, confusing land ownership laws, arbitrary application of regulations, and crime. Companies report that contracts are often violated and that Nigeria’s system for settling commercial disputes is weak and often biased. Frequent power outages, as well as poor road, port, rail, and aviation transportation infrastructure, pose a major challenge FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 383 to doing business in Nigeria. These factors hinder Nigeria’s ability to compete in regional and international markets. Foreign exchange restrictions have negatively impacted investment as well as trade.

Similarly, the CBN has on occasion restricted the repatriation of earnings, causing some businesses to reduce services in Nigeria.",42,NIGERIA
OTHER BARRIERS,"Port Congestion, Inefficiency, and Maritime Crime",42,NIGERIA
"Port Congestion, Inefficiency, and Maritime Crime","Delays caused by congestion and the poor condition of access roads, combined with corruption issues, make operations at Nigerian ports among the most expensive in the world. According to shipping industry reports, Apapa in Lagos is among the most expensive ports in the world for shipments from the United States, due to an average delay of 30 days to clear a container ship. Lagos ports also lack adequate space, and ships often queue for days, and in some cases weeks and months, before being able to berth and discharge their contents. Nigeria estimates that it loses $55.6 million daily because of traffic gridlock at the main port in Lagos. In addition, maritime crime in the Gulf of Guinea, much of it emanating from Nigeria, has a deleterious effect on maritime trade.",42,NIGERIA
Oil and Gas Sector,"The highly trade restrictive Oil and Gas Content Development Act (the Act) of 2010 has imposed broad- ranging local content requirements on projects in Nigeria’s oil and gas sector. Under the Act, all companies operating in this sector must give preferential treatment to Nigerian goods and services and prioritize Nigerian nationals when hiring. The Act’s scope is broad, covering any activity or transaction carried out in, or connected with, the oil and gas industry. The Act’s local sourcing mandate, which applies to an extensive list of goods and services supplied to the oil and gas industry, has been a particular concern of U.S. oil and gas service suppliers. Companies must also create and seek approval for a “Nigerian Content Plan” to demonstrate how they will increase local content in their oil and gas operations. Companies that do not follow a Nigerian Content Plan face large fines or cancellation of contracts. Majority foreign-owned companies operating in the sector must also deposit 10 percent of their annual profit in a Nigerian bank. Restrictions also apply to personnel matters. While Nigeria imposes general quotas on foreign personnel, the quotas are especially strict in the oil and gas sectors. Oil and gas companies must hire Nigerian workers, unless they can demonstrate that particular positions require expertise not found in the local workforce. Positions in finance and human resources are almost exclusively reserved for Nigerians. Certain geosciences and management positions may be filled by foreign workers with the approval of the National Petroleum Investment and Management Services (NAPIMS). Each oil company must negotiate its foreign worker allotment with NAPIMS. Significant delays in this process, and in approvals of visas for foreign personnel, present serious challenges to the oil and gas industry. According to stakeholders, the Act continues to adversely affect a diverse range of companies, including operators, contractors, subcontractors, and service suppliers. Majority foreign-owned companies continue to observe that the Act significantly adds to the cost of doing business in Nigeria. 384 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS",42,NIGERIA
Corruption,Corruption remains a substantial barrier to trade and investment in Nigeria. Corruption and lack of transparency in tender processes have been great concerns to U.S. companies. U.S. firms experience difficulties in day-to-day operations due to inappropriate demands from officials for “facilitative” payments. Efforts to strengthen anticorruption measures have been hampered by inter-ministry infighting and partisan politics.

Norway’s average MFN applied tariff rate was 40.4 percent for agricultural products and 0.4 percent for non-agricultural products in 2019. Norway has bound 100 percent of its tariff lines in the WTO, with an average World Trade Organization (WTO) bound tariff rate of 20.2 percent. Although the EEA Accord does not generally apply to agricultural products, it includes provisions on raw material price compensation that are meant to increase trade in processed food. Norway has a special agreement within the EEA Accord that results in Norway applying a preferential duty on European Union (EU) processed food products. The special agreement provides preferential access for EU suppliers for a wide range of products, including bread and baked goods, breakfast cereals, chocolate and other candies, ice cream, pasta, pizza, soups, and sauces. Such preferential access for EU suppliers disadvantages U.S. exporters of these processed foods. Although Norway is less than 50 percent self-sufficient in agricultural production, it maintains tariff rates on agricultural products as high as several hundred percent to protect domestic agricultural interests. Domestic agricultural shortages and price surges are offset by temporary tariff reductions. However, a lack of predictability in tariff adjustments and insufficient advance notification of these adjustments––generally only two to five days before implementation––favor nearby European suppliers and make export of products from the United States, especially fruits, vegetables, and other perishable horticultural products, very difficult.

However, some concerns remain that the provisions do not contain sufficient mechanisms or requirements to notify right holders of proposed ECLs and the possible application of an ECL to their work. A general ECL provision should include notice to affected right holders, both before and after a collecting society negotiates an agreement that will apply to a certain class of works and/or a class of right holder. A pre-agreement notification mechanism is important so that right holders may present views on whether the legal requirements for the ECL have been met.

GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT,"The FTA requires covered government entities in Oman to conduct procurements covered by the agreement in a fair, transparent, and nondiscriminatory manner. Oman provides a 10 percent price preference to tenders that contain a high content of local goods or services, including direct employment of Omani nationals. However, Oman may not apply such price preferences to bids offering goods and services from the United States in procurement covered by the FTA. For most major tenders, Oman invites bids from international firms or firms pre-selected by project consultants. Suppliers are requested to be present at the opening of tenders, and interested persons may view the process on Oman’s electronic tendering platform, Tender Board. Some U.S. companies report that award decisions are delayed, sometimes for years, or that the tendering is reopened with modified specifications and short deadlines. Oman is not a Party to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA), but has been an observer to the WTO Committee on Government Procurement since May 2001. In accordance with the commitment in its WTO accession, Oman began negotiations to accede to the WTO GPA in 2001, but it has not completed the accession process.",44,OMAN
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION,"Oman committed in the FTA to provide strong intellectual property (IP) protection and enforcement. Oman revised its IP laws and regulations to implement its FTA commitments and acceded to several international IP treaties. While IP laws in Oman are strong, the Omani system places a burden on right holders to perform their own monitoring and enforcement through legal actions in the courts. U.S. stakeholders have faced difficulty getting the responsible government agencies to take enforcement action. The Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Investment Promotion established an IP enforcement group in 2019 as provided for in the GCC Trademark Law of 2019. However, this IP enforcement group is not yet active. Law firms in Oman point to continued confusion about which agency is responsible for investigating different types of IP",44,OMAN

Limitations on Foreign Equity Participation,"In 2019, Oman banned foreign ownership of real estate and land in certain governorates and areas that the government deems necessary to restrict under Royal Decree 29/2018. In 2020, Oman extended the deadline for the sale and handover of land and real estate owned by non-Omanis in prohibited areas until October 31, 2021. However, Oman has allowed the establishment of real estate investment funds (REIF) in order to encourage new inflows of capital into Oman’s property sector. The regulations permit foreign investors, as well as expatriates in Oman, to own shares in REIFs. In October 2020, Oman’s Ministry of Housing and Urban Planning issued a decision granting non-Omanis usufruct rights (i.e., the right to lease one’s property to another person) for the purchase of units in multi- storied commercial and residential buildings in certain areas of the Muscat Governorate, with certain restrictions. The restrictions include that the percentage of units sold to expatriates should not exceed 40 percent of the total number of units in a multi-story commercial or residential building; that members of any particular nationality should not acquire more than 20 percent of units sold to expatriates; and, that any foreign buyer must have been a resident of Oman for over two years at the time of application.

Technical Barriers to Trade,"Pakistan’s food packaging requirements normally follow Codex Alimentarius Commission standards. Pakistan generally accepts packaging material if allowed in the exporting country. A notable exception, however, is food packaging for vegetable oil. Pakistan requires refined vegetable oil be imported in bulk for re-packaging, a requirement aimed at encouraging local packaging and saving foreign exchange.

Sanitary and Phytosanitary Barriers,"Pakistan has not fully recognized the United States’ negligible risk status for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). In 2013, the United States received a negligible risk status for BSE in accordance with World Animal Health Organization (OIE) guidelines. In February 2015, Pakistan established import requirements for the import of live cattle from the United States. On March 2, 2016, more than 300 Holstein heifers arrived in Punjab Province from the United States, representing the first such shipment since 1999. Since then, Pakistan has imported additional shipments of U.S. live cattle, with the latest shipment (1765 head) in November, 2019. However, Pakistan continues to impose cattle age and origin requirements for U.S. beef and beef products, ostensibly over BSE concerns, despite OIE’s consideration of these factors in its negligible risk status determination. The United States continues to work with the MOC and the Ministry of National Food Security and Research to fully open the market for U.S. beef. The government of Punjab has established trait-based semen import requirements that would limit market access to imported semen for dairy and beef producers. The federal and provincial governments are reviewing the matter, but no timeframe has been set for its resolution. In 2005, Pakistan enacted a biosafety law establishing biosafety committees that govern the manufacture, research, import, export, and sales of genetically modified plants, animals, microorganisms, and cells. As of September 2020, Pakistan had not yet established rules and administrative protocols to implement the 2005 rules, and, as a result, requirements for the certification and importation of genetically engineered (GE) food and agricultural products remain unclear. National regulatory bodies are in different stages of promulgating rules and administrative procedures governing agricultural biotechnology. Once complete, the resulting rules and administrative procedures will need to be harmonized in order to operate effectively and enable companies to legally register genetically engineered products for food, feed, and processing purposes. In October 2020, the Ministry of Climate Change established a sub-committee to formulate policy and procedure to regulate or ban the import of GE grains for food, feed, and processing. The work of this sub-committee is on-going.",45,PAKISTAN

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION,"Pakistan remained on the Watch List in the Special 301 Report. Intellectual property (IP) concerns in Pakistan were raised in June and December 2020 during TIFA intersessional meetings involving representatives of the U.S. and Pakistani Governments. In recent years, Pakistan has undertaken efforts to implement key provisions of the Intellectual Property Organization of Pakistan (IPO-Pakistan) Act of 2012 and has devoted increased attention and resources to IP issues, including with respect to: (1) U.S.-Pakistan bilateral engagement, especially under the U.S.- Pakistan TIFA; (2) the establishment of IP tribunals; (3) public awareness campaigns on IP protection and enforcement; (4) IPO participation with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in a series of video conferences devoted to reviewing IP legislation; and, (5) ongoing engagement with stakeholders. Despite these improvements, as the Special 301 Report noted, Pakistan must do significantly more to improve IP protection and enforcement. For example, with respect to the establishment of IP tribunals, litigants with experience in these courts have raised concerns over the lack of capacity, consistency, and insufficient penalties assessed by tribunal judges. Pakistan’s ongoing but unfinished efforts to align its patent, trademark, and copyright laws, and IP regulations and enforcement regimes with international standards continues to be an area for further progress. Moreover, counterfeiting and piracy in Pakistan remain high, particularly in the areas of pharmaceuticals, printed materials, optical media, digital content, and software.

The scope of “critical” personal data is not defined. Such data localization requirements are ineffective at enhancing the protection of personal data, and would significantly increase costs for U.S. firms, potentially deterring market entry.",45,PAKISTAN
Internet Services,"In November 2020, Pakistan adopted the Removal and Blocking of Unlawful Online Content (Procedure, Oversight, and Safeguards) Rules. The Rules apply to the remove and/or blocking of online content that is deemed unlawful on any information system. Industry has indicated that the scope of the final Rules is unclear and may be interpreted to apply to any information technology company operating in Pakistan. When a draft of the rules was released, U.S. industry expressed concerns regarding provisions that would pose significant barriers to operating in Pakistan, including burdensome registration and licensing requirements, content restrictions, requirements that companies maintain a physical presence in Pakistan, and possible data localization requirements. Responding to concerns raised by U.S. companies and others, Pakistani authorities pledged in February 2020 to consult with relevant stakeholders. The Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication and the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority (PTA) consulted with foreign companies and other stakeholders, but they did not circulate a revised version of the rules for feedback before sending it to Pakistani Cabinet. The rules were approved by the Pakistani Cabinet and finalized in November 2020. Pakistan periodically blocks access to Internet services for hosting content deemed to be “blasphemous” or “immoral” or on grounds that such services can be used to “undermine national security.” In September 2020, PTA blocked five “dating” websites, including a U.S. company, citing alleged circulation of “immoral” content. PTA has also sent notices to U.S. based social media platforms, threatening adverse action if those platforms did not remove objectionable content. Throughout 2020, Pakistan has partially suspended access to mobile data and certain online services in major cities several times. However, Pakistan has recently refrained from blocking online services for the entire country, as it did 11 times in 2018. Such blockages undermine the value of Internet services and impose costs on local firms that depend on such services. Pakistan is considering adoption of an E-commerce Policy Framework. In January 2020, the government made the draft available for public comment. U.S. industry expressed concerns regarding some aspects of the Framework, such as customs duties on digital goods imported into Pakistan, the requirement to disclose the facility where data is stored, the obligation for businesses to maintain a physical address in Pakistan, and the restriction on payments to unauthorized or unregistered sites and apps.

INVESTMENT BARRIERS,"Pakistan generally permits foreign investment, with equity caps in key sectors including agriculture, aviation, banking, defense, media, insurance, and railways. In an effort to combat tax evasion, in which companies report operating losses but remit royalties, Pakistan has limited foreign investors’ remittance of royalty payments to a maximum of $100,000 for the first payment, with subsequent payments capped at 5 percent of net sales for the next 5 years. Foreign investors are allowed to invest in all sectors except sectors related to the production of arms, ammunition, high explosives, radioactive substances, securities, currency, and consumable alcohol. There are no restrictions or mechanisms that exclude U.S. investors specifically. As envisioned by the 2013 Investment Policy, the 2017 Companies Act eliminated minimum initial capital investment requirements across sectors so that no minimum investment requirement or upper limit on the share of foreign equity is allowed, with the exception of the airline, banking, agriculture, and media sectors. Foreign investors in the services sector may retain 100 percent equity, subject to obtaining permission (i.e., a “no objection” certificate or license) from the concerned agency and fulfilling the requirements of any applicable sectoral policy.

Severe penalties and fines may result if a court determines that the foreign company ended the relationship with its distributor without first having established that such “just cause” exists. This requirement often leads to expensive out-of-court settlements. The law has impeded foreign investment because of concerns that Paraguayan companies may unreasonably threaten expensive litigation. Judicial uncertainty and corruption mar Paraguay’s investment climate. Many investors find it difficult to adequately enforce contracts and are frustrated by lengthy bureaucratic procedures. The Government of Paraguay has taken steps to increase transparency and accountability, including the passage of its Access to Information Law, but corruption and impunity continue to hamper the investment climate.

Tariffs,"The Philippines’ average Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) applied tariff rate was 6.1 percent in 2019. The Philippines’ average MFN applied tariff rate was 9.8 percent for agricultural products and 5.5 percent for non-agricultural products in 2019. The Philippines has bound 66.9 percent of its tariff lines in the World Trade Organization (WTO), with an average WTO bound tariff rate of 25.7 percent. Products with unbound tariffs include certain automobiles, chemicals, plastics, vegetable textile fiber, footwear, headgear, fish, and paper products. MFN applied tariffs on fresh fruit, including grapes, apples, oranges, lemons, grapefruits, and strawberries, as well as on processed potato products (including frozen fries), are between 7 percent and 15 percent (except dates and figs, which have a 3 percent MFN applied tariff). WTO bound rates are much higher at 35 percent and 50 percent, including for fresh potatoes at 40 percent. U.S. agricultural exports are significantly inhibited by the high in-quota tariffs for agricultural products under the Philippines’ tariff-rate quota (TRQ) program, known as the Minimum Access Volume (MAV) system. Under the MAV system, the Philippines imposes TRQs on numerous agricultural products, including sugar, corn, coffee and coffee extracts, potatoes, pork, and poultry products, with in-quota tariffs ranging from 30 percent to 50 percent. The Philippines continues to apply high tariffs on finished automobiles and motorcycles. A 30 percent tariff is imposed on completely built passenger vehicles with capacity of less than 10 persons (i.e., cars) as FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 417 well as motorcycles; 20 percent for passenger vehicles with capacity of 10 or more (i.e., buses); and, 20 percent for commercial vehicles (i.e., trucks).

Export Subsidies,"The Philippines offers a wide array of fiscal incentives for export-oriented investments, particularly investments related to manufacturing. These incentives are available to firms located in designated export processing zones, free port zones, and other special industrial estates registered with the Philippine Economic Zone Authority. The available incentives include: income tax holidays or exemptions from corporate income tax for four years, renewable for a maximum of eight years; after the income-tax-holiday period, payment of a five percent special tax on gross income less allowable deductions in lieu of all national and local taxes; exemption from duties and taxes on imported capital equipment, machinery, spare parts, and raw materials; exemption from wharfage dues, imposts, and fees; and a zero percent VAT rate on local purchases, including telecommunications, electricity, water, and lease of building. Additionally, under the Export Development Act, exporters are entitled to tax credits, starting from 2.5 percent for the first 5 percent increase in annual export revenue, and an additional 5 percent and 7.5 percent for the next two succeeding 5 percent increases in annual export revenues. A pending tax reform bill, known as the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises Act contains language that would eliminate these preferential tax rates and benefits, but as of March 2021, the Philippine Congress had not adopted any such changes.

The U.S. Government continues to engage with industry to analyze and assess the impact of sanctions on trade in the broader context of U.S. national interests.

GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT,"Russia is not a Party to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA), but has been an observer to the WTO Committee on Government Procurement since May 2013. In its WTO Accession Protocol, Russia committed to request observer status to the WTO Committee on Government Procurement and to begin negotiating to join the WTO GPA within four years of its WTO accession. On August 19, 2016 Russia informed GPA Members of its intent to initiate negotiations to join the GPA. However, Russia’s GPA accession negotiations did not start until Russia submitted its initial offer in June 2017 and its replies to the Checklist of Issues in September 2018. When it joined the WTO, Russia committed its government agencies to award contracts in a transparent manner according to published laws, regulations, and guidelines. Russia has adopted certain local content requirements relating to federal or municipal government procurement that it argues are not subject to the national treatment obligations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the General Agreement on Trade in Services. Given the breadth of the Russian Government’s role in the economy and the scope of the numerous import substitution policies and local content requirements, such measures impede trade because U.S. exports are excluded from a broad section of the Russian economy. Government procurement restrictions have accelerated since 2014 when Russia established a 15 percent preference for a variety of goods (including certain food products, pharmaceuticals, steel, machinery, and medical products) produced in the EAEU in purchases for government use. In addition, Russia has banned states and municipalities from purchasing foreign-made automobiles, other vehicles, and machinery, and banned procurement of a broad array of consumer goods produced outside the EAEU. The Industrial Policy Law, adopted in 2015, specifically promotes import substitution and localization, restricting government procurement (and SOE purchases) of foreign-made products. It provides a framework for the support of innovative product manufacturing, research and development subsidies, and infrastructure projects as well as implementation of the Buy Russia law. The law also includes provisions for financial and material support to Russian companies to boost their export potential. To implement the Industrial Policy Law, Russia has established local content requirements for a variety of industrial product sectors, including machine tools, automotive, special mechanical engineering, photonics and lighting, electrical-technical, cable, and heavy machinery. As a consequence, for example, some types of metalworking equipment must contain from 20 percent to 50 percent domestic parts, with increasing targets each subsequent year. Since 2015, Russia has reaffirmed and expanded the ban on government procurement of a wide range of foreign-made products, including, but not limited to, furniture, vehicles, machinery and equipment, tools, appliances, paper and cardboard, and shoes and clothing. In addition, Russia banned government procurement of numerous foreign-made medical devices and health-related disposable goods if more than two companies from the EAEU Member States submitted a bid and in 2020 released a list of more than 200 strategically important medicines that must be produced in Russia. The Russian Government has also banned a list of certain food and dairy products from non-EAEU Member States for government and municipal procurement, including fresh and frozen fish, fish products, canned fish, salt, beef, pork, veal, poultry, cheese, cottage cheese, rice, butter, and sugar and established minimum purchasing requirements of domestic goods. In April 2020, the Government of Russia introduced yet another series of bans and restrictions on the admission of foreign industrial goods for the purpose of public procurement and procurement for the needs of national defense and state security. Russia has expanded the reach of its import substitution policies into the technology sector. Pursuant to FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 443 amendments to Russia’s national procurement law, Russia has created a registry of Russian software. Foreign-made software not on the list will no longer routinely qualify for government and municipal procurement unless no similar domestically produced software is available. In July 2016, the Russian Government went a step further and issued an order that approved a three-year plan to switch government agencies to Russian office software. According to U.S. stakeholders, because the move to domestic software was not moving fast enough, the Russian Government in 2020 proposed measures that would expand the list of companies considered Critical Information Infrastructure (CII), and thus extend to many private companies the import substitution requirements and local content requirements applied to government entities. Such a move would limit the ability of foreign-controlled entities to provide IT",51,RUSSIA
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION,"Russia remained on the Priority Watch List in the Special 301 Report. Challenges to intellectual property (IP) protection and enforcement in Russia include continued copyright infringement, trademark counterfeiting, and the existence of non-transparent procedures governing the operation of collective management organizations (CMOs). Despite recent implementation of anti-piracy legislation, Russia remains home to several sites that facilitate online piracy, as identified in the Notorious Markets List. Stakeholders continue to report that Russia needs to direct more action to rogue online platforms targeting audiences outside the country. While the right holders are able to obtain court-ordered injunctions against infringing websites, investigations and prosecutions of the owners of the large commercial websites distributing pirated material, including software, are lacking. Also, stakeholders report that in the past few years, use of mobile applications to access pirated content has increased exponentially. In 2018, right holders and online platforms in Russia signed an anti-piracy memorandum to facilitate the removal of links to infringing websites. This memorandum may be implemented as legislation that would cover all copyrighted works and apply to all Russian platforms and search engines. In addition, the Duma has approved amendments to legislation that attempts to address the increasing use of mobile applications to access illicit content. Russia remains a thriving market for counterfeit goods sourced from China. Despite increased seizures by the Federal Customs Service, certain policies hamper IP enforcement efforts. For example, the return to sender policy for small consignments, which returns counterfeit goods to their producer, is problematic because it does not remove such goods from channels of commerce. Royalty collection by CMOs in Russia continues to lack transparency and lags behind the international standards. Reports indicate that right holders are denied detailed accounting reports, making it difficult to verify how much money is being collected and distributed. Also, right holders are excluded from the selection and management of CMOs. Finally, stakeholders have also raised concerns related to the protection against the unfair commercial use, as well as the unauthorized disclosure, of undisclosed test or other data generated to obtain marketing approval for pharmaceutical products.

BARRIERS TO DIGITAL TRADE,Data Localization,51,RUSSIA
Data Localization,"In 2015, Russia adopted legislation requiring that certain data collected electronically by companies on Russian citizens be processed and stored in Russia. Such requirements impose steep costs and significant operational challenges not only on providers of data storage and processing services, as well as a wide array of other data-intensive services, but also on manufacturers who rely on those services. Initially, nominal fines were introduced and noncompliant sites were blocked by the Russian Government, but in 2019, legislation was adopted raising the fines for non-compliance to as high as RUB 18 million (approximately $250,000). Industry stakeholders continue to raise concerns that the law limits their ability to offer a variety of services in Russia and increases the cost of doing business in Russia – particularly for small and medium- sized enterprises. In 2016, Russia adopted the Yarovaya Amendments, requiring certain telecommunications and internet operators to store certain communications content locally for six months and store metadata related to such content for one year or longer, depending on the type of provider. In 2020, however, some of the deadlines to move data back to Russia and to increase local data-storage capacity were delayed by one year. Industry representatives assert that the Yarovaya Amendments, under the guise of fighting terrorism, may require companies to assist government authorities in decrypting user communications, and prohibit encryption measures unless a decryption key is provided to the Russian authorities upon request. Industry has also raised a concern about the requirement that Russian Internet service providers (ISPs) must install a special device on their servers to allow the Russian security services to track all credit card transactions. Russia has also implemented restrictions on consumers’ use of virtual private networks (VPNs) and threatened to shut off market access for ISPs that allow VPNs to exist or function without being blocked. U.S. companies are concerned that these provisions may require them to provide the Russian Government with excessive access to citizens’ private information.",51,RUSSIA

State-Owned Enterprises,"Russia’s numerous SOEs play a prominent role across much of Russia’s economy. The Russian Accounts Chamber has estimated that SOEs account for about 48 percent of Russia’s economy. While private enterprises are theoretically allowed to compete with SOEs on the same terms and conditions, in practice, the competitive playing field can be distorted in favor of SOEs. These advantages result from SOEs’ lack of transparency and lack of independence; subsidization by the government; access to preferential lending by state-owned banks; unclear responsibilities of their boards of directors; misalignment of managers’ incentives and company performance; inadequate control mechanisms on managers’ total remuneration or their use of assets transferred by the government to the SOEs; and minimal disclosure requirements. In December 2014, the Russian Government reversed a prohibition against senior government officials serving on the boards of SOEs, further tilting the playing field in favor of SOEs or state-controlled enterprises by re-introducing a governmental or political voice in the companies’ decision-making processes. Government ministers or deputy ministers chair the boards of Russian Railways, RusHydro, Rostelecom, Transneft, and Russian Grids (Rosseti). FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 447 A specific variant of SOEs, state corporations, are completely owned by the government and operate under separate legislation and in a marketplace skewed in their favor. For example, state corporation holding structures and management arrangements (e.g., senior government officials as board members) create conditions for preferential treatment, while the case-by-case legal construction of state corporations (by virtue of their separate legal framework) leaves much scope for discretion and lobbying by company insiders at the expense of private enterprises. There are six state corporations: Rosatom, VEB, Fund for Communal Housing, Deposit Insurance Agency, Roskosmos, and Rostec. In December 2019, the government approved the 2020–2022 Privatization Plan and plans to privatize fully 86 federal state unitary enterprises and sell its stakes in 186 joint stock companies and in 13 limited liability companies. The Russian Government still maintains a list of 136 SOEs with “national significance” that are either wholly or partially owned by Russia and whose privatization is permitted only with a special governmental decree, including Aeroflot, Rosneftegaz, Transneft, Russian Railways, and VTB. However, Russia has been slow in implementing the privatization plan. The treatment of foreign investors in privatizations conducted to date has been inconsistent, with foreign participation at times confined to minority stakes, creating concerns about protection for minority shareholders and corporate governance.",51,RUSSIA
Investment Taxes,"U.S. companies have also raised concerns about Russian tax authorities’ scrutiny of payments that cross Russia’s borders, but remain, for tax purposes, in the legal structure of the same Russian company. This issue has arisen chiefly in two contexts: (1) when a multinational company transfers an employee temporarily to the company’s Russian office from another office outside Russia, and (2) in intra-company payments for the use of intellectual property. Under internationally accepted accounting standards, these normal business practices are handled as an intra-firm payment from one office to the other, or to the headquarters in the case of royalty payments. However, Russian tax inspectors have in the past disputed such expenses as economically unjustified and, consequently, not permissible under the Russian Tax Code.",51,RUSSIA
Local Content Requirements,"Russia maintains an investment incentive regime in the automotive sector with domestic content requirements and production targets. The first program, introduced in 2005, allowed for the duty-free entry of automotive parts used in the production of vehicles that contained at least 30 percent Russian content and required that automotive manufacturers produce at least 25,000 units domestically. In December 2010, Russia initiated a second automotive industry investment incentive program that increased significantly the required domestic production volume to 300,000 units and the domestic content requirement to 60 percent. Automotive producers also had to agree to establish a research and development center in Russia and to comply with the requirement that engines and transmissions should represent 30 percent of the output in Russia. According to Russia’s Auto Industry Development Strategy, localization should reach 70 percent by 2025. As part of its WTO accession protocol, Russia agreed to consult with the United States and other WTO Members on WTO-consistent measures it could take in this sector, and to end the WTO-inconsistent elements of the automotive industry incentive programs by July 1, 2018. Russia is extending state support programs for the automotive industry into 2020, focusing on car loans and leasing program support. For example, automakers were required to launch engine production in 2019 to continue to receive state support. Russia has also set deadlines for the assembly of automatic transmissions and electric motors for 2023 and 2026, respectively, for automakers seeking continued state support. Such local content requirements remain a barrier to U.S. exports of automotive parts, and the United States will work with Russia to eliminate the problematic elements of these programs. 448 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS",51,RUSSIA
OTHER BARRIERS,Export Policies,51,RUSSIA
Export Policies,"Russia maintains export duties on 157 types of products for both revenue and policy purposes. For example, a variety of products are subject to export tariffs, such as certain fish products, oilseeds, fertilizers, non- ferrous metals, hides and skins, and wood products. Russia has indicated that it intends to eliminate gradually most of these duties, except for those applied to products deemed strategically significant, such as hydrocarbons and certain scrap metals. However, in 2016, Russia introduced export duties on certain chemicals and anodes of the platinum group of metals. Russia has also banned the export of raw hides intermittently since 2014 in order to protect its leather processing industry. In December 2020, the Russian Government imposed temporary tariff rate quotas for exports of wheat, rye, barley and corn; in January 2021, the Russian Government increased the within-quota export duty on wheat, corn and barley. The Russian Government also increased the export duties on soybeans and sunflower seeds. Russia retains the ability to modify these export duties expeditiously if the need arises, contributing to uncertainty in the market. In September 2020, the Russian President ordered the government to impose a complete ban on exports of raw and crudely processed forest products from Russia as of January 1, 2022. Russia maintains a list of products that are deemed essentially significant for the domestic market and hence could become subject to export restrictions or prohibitions. In 2015, Russia amended the list to include a variety of steel and non-ferrous metal scrap. Because Russia is a major source of scrap on global markets and a major steel producer, this addition contributed to the uncertainty of the availability of Russian scrap for export to global markets and caused concern among U.S. stakeholders of possible market distortions. Such concerns were realized in August 2019, when Russia placed a four-month quota on exports on ferrous waste and scrap to territories outside the EAEU; the quota was in effect between September and December of 2019. As of December 2018, precious metals ores and concentrates have also been added to the list of products subject to potential export restraint, as have certain waste or scrap of precious metal or of metal clad. Historically, Russia has maintained high export duties on crude oil to encourage domestic refining. Although Russia committed to cut its export duties on oil and oil products to the level of Kazakhstan as part of the process to establish the EAEU, in late 2015, the Russian Government suspended the planned duty reductions for at least one year in order to gain extra revenue in light of economic pressures. Amendments to the Tax Code signed into law on November 24, 2014, and known as the tax maneuver, will gradually reduce export duties on oil and light oil products and increase the mineral extraction tax and export duties for refined products to compensate for the resulting loss of federal budget revenues. The change will make domestic crude more expensive for domestic refiners. Separately, Russia maintains a 30 percent export tax on natural gas. Stakeholders claim that Russia has placed higher rail freight rates on certain raw materials intended for export, contrary to its WTO commitment to eliminate discrepancies in such rates by July 1, 2013. Since June 2015, Russia has not lowered its rail freight rates charged on certain materials for exports or otherwise worked to eliminate the differential freight rates.

Technical Barriers to Trade,"Over the past few years, Saudi Arabia has revised technical regulations for a variety of products relying primarily on standards developed by the International Organization for Standardization and International Electrotechnical Commission. Saudi Arabia has been increasingly reluctant to accept certain other international standards that may meet or exceed Saudi Arabia’s objectives, including those developed by U.S.-domiciled organizations through open, transparent, and consensus-based processes. Saudi Arabia’s refusal to accept these other international standards, which are often used by U.S. manufacturers, creates significant market access restrictions for certain industrial and consumer products exported from the United States, including protective footwear, electrical equipment, and appliances.

GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT,"Foreign contractors must subcontract 30 percent of the value of any government procurement, including support services, to firms that are majority-owned by Saudi nationals. An exemption is granted when no Saudi-owned company can provide the goods or services necessary to fulfill the requirements of a tender. Foreign suppliers also are required to establish a training program for Saudi nationals. However, most defense procurement is negotiated on a case-by-case basis. The Saudi Government is in the process of reforming its procurement processes and policies to incorporate new ambitious goals of Saudi employment and localized production. In addition to offsets, the Saudi Government is focused on “localization” of purchases of goods and services, and increasing the percentage of Saudi nationals employed by foreign firms, known as “Saudization.” Previously, the government required offsets in investments up to 40 percent of a program’s value for defense contracts, depending on the value of the contract. Saudi Arabia provides a 10 percent price preference for GCC goods for procurements in which foreign suppliers participate. Saudi Arabia revised its Government Tenders and Procurement Law and the amendments were approved on April 24, 2020. The law regulates the contractual relationship between a public/government entity and contractors in terms of government tenders. U.S. companies have reported long delays and difficulties in receiving payments for procurement contracts with national and regional government entities, with some delays lasting more than two years. Delays increased significantly in late 2015, when declining oil revenues prompted the Saudi Government to freeze payments to major contractors, accruing tens of billions of dollars in arrears and leading some companies to lay off workers. U.S. companies continue to report significant payment delays. Foreign companies are permitted to provide services to the Saudi Government directly without a local agent and to market their services to other public entities through an office that has been granted temporary registration from the Ministry of Commerce. Foreign companies solely providing services to the government, if not already registered to do business in Saudi Arabia, are required to obtain a temporary registration from the Ministry within 30 days of signing a contract. Saudi Arabia is not a Party to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA), but has been an observer to the WTO Committee on Government Procurement since December 2007.

The Saudi Authority for Intellectual Property has taken steps to improve IP protection, IP enforcement, and IP awareness throughout Saudi Arabia. However, the SFDA continues to grant marketing approvals to Saudi companies that raise concerns about Saudi Arabia’s system for providing effective protection against unfair commercial use of undisclosed test or other data generated to obtain marketing approval for innovative pharmaceutical products.

The United States continues to remain concerned about reportedly high levels of online piracy in Saudi Arabia, particularly through illicit streaming devices, which right holders report are widely available and generally unregulated in Saudi Arabia. Right holders have expressed further concerns regarding effective civil enforcement of IP rights, including the ability to file civil actions, enforce judgments, and assess deterrent-level fines against infringers. Additionally, right holders remain concerned that criminal sentences and financial penalties are not consistently imposed.

As a general rule, the foreign entity’s equity in the joint venture cannot exceed 75 percent of the total investment; however, this rule is not consistently applied and there are examples of services companies operating in Saudi Arabia without a partner. As part of its 2005 WTO accession commitments, Saudi Arabia generally allows consulting firms to register a local branch or subsidiary without a Saudi partner. In 2017, Saudi Arabia rescinded the requirement for engineering consulting firms to have a 25 percent Saudi partner, provided such a firm can demonstrate it has been incorporated for at least 10 years and has operations in at least 4 different countries. Law firms, like accounting and architecture firms, were previously subject to a 75 percent foreign ownership limit. A judicial decision has created uncertainty around this requirement. In September 2019, the Saudi Government issued a royal decree prohibiting government departments and agencies from granting contracts to foreign consultancy firms, except in circumstances where there are no qualified Saudi alternatives.

Limitations on Foreign Equity Participation,"Foreign investment is currently prohibited in ten sectors, including oil exploration and drilling, security services, fisheries, tourist guidance services related to religious pilgrimage, and services related to military activity. In 2016, Saudi Arabia began to allow full foreign ownership of retail and wholesale businesses, removing the previous 25 percent local ownership requirement. However, foreign investors interested in such ownership are required to satisfy several conditions, including investing more than $50 million in the Saudi economy over five years and meeting sector specific localization requirements. These conditions have limited the ability of foreign investors to exercise full ownership in these sectors. In 2018, Saudi Arabia began to allow foreign ownership in businesses providing services relating to road transportation, real estate brokerage, labor recruitment, and audiovisual display. All foreign investment in Saudi Arabia requires a license from the Ministry of Investment (MISA), which must be renewed periodically. While the MISA is required to grant or refuse an investment license within five days of receiving a complete application, bureaucratic impediments can delay the process. High fees for some investment licenses discourage foreign companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, from entering the Saudi market. Companies can also experience bureaucratic delays after receiving their license, such as delays in obtaining a commercial registry or purchasing property. Only “qualified foreign investors” (QFIs) designated by Saudi Arabia’s Capital Market Authority (CMA) are permitted to buy directly shares listed on the local Tadawul stock exchange. To qualify as a QFI, an entity must be duly licensed or otherwise subject to oversight by a regulatory body with standards equivalent to those of the CMA, and have assets under management of at least $500 million. QFIs may not own more than 10 percent of any individual company, and cumulative foreign ownership cannot exceed 10 percent of the total Tadawul market capitalization or 49 percent of any individual company.

GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT,"The 2011 Local Procurement Accord (the Accord) signed between the South African Government and business, labor, and community stakeholders commits the government to significantly expand the value of goods and services it procures from South Africa suppliers. The Accord included an “aspirational target” of sourcing 75 percent of government procurement locally to boost industrialization and to create jobs. South Africa’s National Industrial Participation Program, introduced in 1996, imposes an industrial participation obligation on all government and parastatal purchases or lease contracts for goods, equipment, or services, with an imported content greater than or equal to $10 million. This obligation requires the seller or supplier to engage in local commercial or industrial activity valued at 30 percent or more of the value of the imported content of the goods or services purchased or leased pursuant to a government tender.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION,"The South African Government has taken some positive steps toward more effective enforcement of intellectual property (IP), including appointing additional enforcement officials, improving the training provided to these officials, and increasing public awareness of IP. However, stakeholders report significant concerns. In March 2019, the South African Parliament passed the Copyright Amendment Bill and the Performers’ Protection Amendment Bill that contain some needed modernizations of the copyright law, such as the introduction of the right of communication to the public. However, these bills also contain provisions that some stakeholders assert will weaken the adequacy and effectiveness of copyright and related rights protection in South Africa. Specific concerns include broad and ambiguous exceptions to copyright, new limitations on contractual relations between private parties, and a provision prohibiting the circumvention of technological protection measures that may not meet international standards, such as with respect to overly broad exceptions. In March 2019, the bills passed Parliament and were sent to the South African President for signature. However, the South African President sent the bills back to Parliament citing constitutional concerns in June of 2020, and, as of February 2021, Parliament has not taken action in response. Significant numbers of South African and international stakeholders, particularly in the creative industries, oppose the bills in their current form. The DTIC released the Intellectual Property Policy of the Republic of South Africa Phase I (IP Policy) in 2018, which lays the groundwork for future legislation and regulations governing IP in South Africa. Stakeholders have raised concerns that the IP Policy advocates for weaker exclusive patent rights, among other things. Under the SADC EPA, which entered into force on a provisional basis in 2016, South Africa agreed to prohibit the use of certain terms that may be common names by recognizing them as Geographical Indications in its domestic market. The United States remains highly concerned about countries negotiating product-specific IP outcomes as a condition of market access from the EU and reiterates the importance of each IP right being independently evaluated on its individual merits. 468 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS",54,SOUTH AFRICA

INVESTMENT BARRIERS,"While South Africa is generally open to greenfield foreign direct investment (FDI), merger and acquisition- related FDI is scrutinized closely for its impact on jobs and local industry. South Africa also imposes local content requirements on investments in certain sectors such as renewable energy projects. The B-BBEE, and associated codes of good practice, awards bidding preferences on government tenders and contracts to firms with the requisite levels of company ownership and participation by Black South Africans. The B-BBEE Codes of Good Practice creates a certification system (a “B-BBEE scorecard”) that rates a company’s commitment to the empowerment of historically disadvantaged people in South Africa. A strong rating is particularly important in competition for public tenders, as the B-BBEE scorecard will account for 10 percent of a bid’s assessment. It also is important for branding purposes and for managing client relationships, as a company’s score can influence a client’s own B-BBEE score. The government has made B-BBEE requirements stricter in recent years, causing concern among U.S. firms that have struggled to score well on the “ownership” element of the scorecard, due to corporate rules that can prevent the transfer of discounted equity stakes to South African subsidiaries. Whereas U.S. firms once balanced lower scores on ownership requirements with higher scores on other elements, changes to the rules introduced penalties for failing to comply with requirements relating to ownership, management control diversity, enterprise development, and preferential procurement. In addition to ownership, the preferential procurement category requires localization with “empowering suppliers,” which proves challenging to companies importing products or inputs for value chains. Although the government recently created a program called Equity Equivalence (EE) for international companies that cannot meet the ownership element of B-BBEE through the direct sale of equity to local investors, some companies have reported that the reporting requirements and high level of required financial contributions make the EE program unviable. Sectors such as financial services, mining, and petroleum have their own “transformation charters” intended to promote accelerated empowerment within those sectors. The charters for the integrated transport, forest products, construction, tourism, and chartered accountancy sectors have force of law in South Africa. Many other sectors, including financial services, information and communications technology, and property, have transformation charters that do not have force of law, yet express the sector’s commitment to “economic transformation.”",54,SOUTH AFRICA

The new rules recognize existing mining right holders who have a minimum 26 percent B-BBEE ownership as compliant, but requires an increase to 30 percent B-BBEE ownership within a 5-year transitional period. Recognition of B-BBEE ownership compliance is not transferable to a new owner. New mining right licenses must have 30 percent B-BBEE",54,SOUTH AFRICA

In October 2020, the South African Government published a draft land expropriation bill for public comment that would amend South Africa’s 1975 Expropriation Act to explicitly allow expropriation of property, including land, without compensation.

Taiwan has bound 100 percent of its tariff lines in the World Trade Organization (WTO), with an average WTO bound tariff rate of 6.8 percent. Taiwan maintained tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) on a number of products when it became a WTO Member in January 2002, including small passenger vehicles, fish products, and agricultural products. Taiwan subsequently eliminated TRQs for four fish products and eight agricultural products. Nevertheless, many TRQs remain in place, especially in the area of agriculture. TRQs still cover 16 agricultural products, including rice, peanuts, bananas, and pineapples. Taiwan has recourse to special safeguards (SSGs) for agricultural products covered by TRQs. SSGs, which are permitted under Article 5 of the WTO Agreement on Agriculture, allow Taiwan to impose additional duties when import quantities exceed SSG trigger volumes or import prices fall below SSG trigger prices. Because Taiwan previously did not import many of these products, its SSG trigger volumes are relatively low.

GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT,"Amendments to the Government Procurement Act went into effect in May 2019. The amended Act adds a national security provision. It also includes a modification requiring a government procurement contract to stipulate the responsibility of either party in the event that its erroneous performance, false representation, or poor management causes damage to the other party. Previously, the Government Procurement Act had applied only to the supplier’s liability. In addition, to avoid a procuring entity’s delay in correcting illegal procurement conduct, the amended Act adds that the procuring entity must proceed with a lawful alternative within 20 days from the date of receipt of a finding by the Complaint Review Board for Government Procurement (CRBGP) that the procuring entity is in breach of regulations. A supplier obtaining a favorable decision against a procuring entity may request that the procuring entity reimburse necessary expenses incurred by the supplier in the preparation of the tender and the filing of a protest and complaint.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION,"Positive developments regarding intellectual property (IP) protection and enforcement in Taiwan include the implementation of amendments to the Pharmaceutical Affairs Act, amendments to the Copyright Act to combat illicit streaming devices, and amendments to the Trade Secrets Act to protect trade secrets during criminal investigations. However, more comprehensive copyright legislation remains stalled, and considerable challenges remain in combatting copyright and related infringement, particularly with respect to online piracy. Implementing regulations for the December 2017 Amendments to the Pharmaceutical Affairs Act went into force in August 2019, establishing a new mechanism for early resolution of potential patent disputes that included coverage for biologics. This mechanism represents a promising step forward for Taiwan in its efforts to develop an innovative pharmaceutical sector. At the same time, right holders have raised concerns that TFDA is excluding patents for new doses, new dosage forms, and new unit strengths from this system. The United States will continue to monitor the implementation of this new mechanism. Following trade and investment discussions in 2018, the United States and Taiwan agreed to a Digital Anti- Piracy Work Plan (the Work Plan). Leading up to, and as a result of, the Work Plan, Taiwan took certain steps in the copyright arena. To combat infringing websites, the Taiwan Intellectual Property Alliance (TIPA) signed a Memorandum of Cooperation with the Taipei Association of Advertising Agencies (TAAA) in August 2017. Under this arrangement, TIPA provides TAAA with an infringing website list, and TAAA distributes the list to its members and advises them not to post advertisements on those websites. Expanding this initiative, the Digital Marketing Association and TIPA signed a voluntary cooperation agreement in July 2019. In May 2019, Article 87.1.8 and Article 93 of the Copyright Act were amended to combat the use of illicit streaming devices. However, right holders report that online piracy remains widespread.

Medical Devices,"Taiwan is a significant market for U.S. medical device exports. In January 2020, Taiwan passed its first Medical Devices Act, after which TFDA began issuing regulations to implement provisions of the Act. However, longstanding concerns persist over Taiwan’s systems for medical device product license approvals and pricing review mechanisms. Although TFDA makes available a simplified application process for regulatory review of medical devices, U.S. manufacturers continue to express concerns with documentation requirements that effectively limit the number of products eligible to benefit from the program. For example, TFDA requires U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) medical device Establishment Inspection Reports (EIRs) that are submitted by U.S. manufacturers in lieu of other documentation to have been issued within the last three years. Because FDA conducts facility inspections using a risk-based approach, rather than at regular intervals, only a small fraction of U.S. manufacturers are able to produce the EIR documentation required to qualify for Taiwan’s simplified review. The United States has encouraged the adoption of audits performed under the International Medical Device Regulatory Forum’s Medical Device Single Audit Program, instead of the FDA EIRs, as it would simplify procedures. In Taiwan, self-pay options are available for implanted devices and a range of other commonly used medical devices that are not approved for NHIA reimbursement. These medical devices must be issued a self-pay code. According to U.S. stakeholders, hospitals that ask patients to self-pay for devices without a code are subject to administrative penalties by NHIA. NHIA began assigning temporary self-pay codes in April 2014, but requires a review of new therapeutic procedures for which the medical device is used. U.S. stakeholders have raised concerns that increased process transparency and faster issuance of temporary self- pay codes are needed to accelerate patient access to new devices. Another concern relates to the implementation of NHIA’s new policy to reduce the items in the self-pay category, under Article 52-4 of the National Health Insurance Act introduced in January 2020. By implementing this policy, NHIA has begun moving medical devices from the self-pay category to the balance billing category with ceiling prices.

Other U.S. concerns include online piracy by devices and applications that allow users to stream and download unauthorized content, overly broad technological protection measure exceptions, unauthorized camcording, unauthorized collective management organizations, the widespread use of unlicensed software in both the public and private sectors, the backlog in pending pharmaceutical patent applications, and extensive cable and satellite signal theft. While the Department of Intellectual Property has drafted amendments to the Copyright Law and Patent Act that could address some concerns, the Thai Parliament has yet to adopt the amendments. The United States will continue to monitor these issues. The United States continues to encourage Thailand to provide an effective system for protecting against the unfair commercial use, as well as unauthorized disclosure, of undisclosed test or other data generated to obtain marketing approval for pharmaceutical and agricultural chemical products. In addition, the United States continues to urge Thailand to engage in a meaningful and transparent manner with all relevant stakeholders before adopting new IP laws, regulations, or guidelines, including on pharmaceutical issues.",57,THAILAND

Although Turkey has large agricultural support programs in place, which include price support programs and input subsidies, Turkey has only recently started submitting overdue updates on domestic support programs to the WTO. In 2018, the update covered subsidies for the years 2001-2009, while in 2019, the update covered subsidies for the years 2010-2013. The United States and other WTO Members continue regularly to raise this transparency and timeliness concern with Turkey at the WTO. Additionally, U.S. exporters have expressed concerns about Turkey’s subsidies and inward processing scheme for wheat.

While the entry into force of Turkey’s Industrial Property Law and implementing decrees brought industrial property rights under a single law, increased the capacity of the Turkish Patent Office, and improved the legal framework for technology commercialization and transfer, IP rights enforcement in Turkey still suffers from a lack of awareness and training among judges, as well as a lack of prioritization among government bodies of efforts to combat IP crimes. U.S. pharmaceutical companies continue to raise concerns that Turkey does not adequately protect against the unfair commercial use, as well as unauthorized disclosure, of test or other data submitted to obtain marketing approval for pharmaceutical products.

Data Localization,"Data localization requirements found in various Turkish laws and regulations restrict the free flow of data and hamper the ability of foreign suppliers of information and communications technology (ICT) services to access the Turkish market. The 2016 Law on the Protection of Personal Data limits transfers of personal data outside of Turkey unless a company meets certain criteria, including (1) explicit consent from the data subject, (2) approval from the Personal Data Protection Authority (KVKK), or (3) involves a transfer to a country whose data protection regime has been deemed by the KVKK as providing adequate protection for such data (as of yet, Turkey has not published a list of approved countries deemed to provide adequate data protection). Companies based outside of Turkey and relying on the transfer of personal data for their operations may find it difficult to comply with these restrictions. Turkey’s data transfer restrictions may result in larger companies being compelled to localize their data in Turkey in order to comply with the law’s data protection requirements, which will likely create a barrier to entry for small- and medium- sized businesses and will increase costs for many firms. In addition, in July 2019, Turkey’s Office of the Presidency published a measure (Circular No. 2019/12) that prohibits public institutions and organizations from using cloud-computing services. The Circular also requires that certain critical information and data, such as health records and biometric data, be stored domestically. In early 2018, the Capital Markets Board of Turkey published the “Communique on Information Systems Management,” which requires publicly traded companies to keep their primary and secondary information systems, data, and infrastructure within Turkey. Turkey’s “Law on Payments and Security Settlement Systems, Payment Services and Electronic Money Institutions” (or “E-Payment Law”) requires information systems used by financial firms for keeping documents and records to be located within Turkey. Many U.S. firms, which depend on a globally distributed network data architecture, view these requirements as unworkable given their business models.

Further, Internet services face potential liability under broad and vague standards for content posted by their users that is deemed blasphemous, discriminatory, or insulting.

Over the past several years, however, as economic and democratic reforms have stalled and in some cases have regressed, foreign investors have become much more cautious. According to balance of payments data from the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT), Turkey attracted a total of $5.6 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2019 (latest data available), down from $6.7 billion in 2018 and the lowest figure since 2004.

Restrictions on Pharmaceutical Reimbursement and Official Exchange Rate for Government Purchases,"U.S. pharmaceutical companies have expressed concerns that their business operations in Turkey are adversely impacted by the Turkish Government’s 2017 decision to restrict reimbursement for pharmaceutical products sold in Turkey and its refusal to adjust adequately the official exchange rate used for government purchases of imported pharmaceutical products. In 2018, the government released two lists totaling approximately 200 pharmaceutical products for which the government would deny reimbursement unless they were manufactured in Turkey. Since government reimbursement covers the vast majority of pharmaceutical products sold in Turkey, U.S. firms assert that denying reimbursement would seriously undermine their ability to market their products in Turkey if they do not manufacture them locally. The government has also indicated it plans an additional three tranches of products to “de-list,” but has not specified dates nor taken any action to implement these further measures. In 2009, companies negotiated with the MOH to sell their products in Turkey using an exchange rate of 1.95 Turkish lira/1.00 Euro (€) for government reimbursements for pharmaceutical products. The government codified this arrangement in a 2009 law, and agreed in that law to adjust the exchange rate if it went up or down by over 15 percent compared to the 2009 baseline. According to U.S. industry, the exchange rate shift against the lira exceeded 15 percent of the baseline in 2011, resulting in an effective price discount in the Turkish market for their products of over 50 percent. Despite multiple Turkish court rulings against the government that obliged it to respect the rate adjustments provided for in the 2009 law, the government only agreed to implement the rulings in 2015; even then, the government arbitrarily chose to reimburse companies for only 70 percent of the previous year’s average daily market exchange rate (reduced to 60 percent in early 2019). The government’s January 2017 pharmaceutical regulation fixed the exchange rate for reimbursement at less than half the current market value. Due to this artificially low reimbursement rate, pharmaceutical companies claim they cannot bring some next-generation drugs to the Turkish market.",59,TURKEY

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION,"Ukraine remained on the Priority Watch List in the Special 301 Report. This designation reflects the continuing need, despite some progress, to address the inadequate protection and enforcement of IP rights and remedy the related market access barriers to U.S. exports and investment. In 2017, the United States announced the partial suspension of Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) benefits to Ukraine due to inadequate protection and enforcement of IP. The announcement specifically referenced the importance of improving Ukraine’s system for collective management organizations (CMOs). In July 2018, Ukraine enacted legislation that fundamentally reformed its CMO system. In 2019, the United States announced the partial restoration of GSP benefits due to tangible steps Ukraine has taken to reform its CMO regime. The United States will continue to work with Ukraine to assist in the development of a transparent, fair and predictable system for the collective management of copyrights. Online piracy and trademark counterfeiting remain a significant problem in Ukraine. In 2020, the Cyber Police launched criminal investigations against several major illicit websites. However, as outlined in the Notorious Markets List, both physical and online markets that facilitate significant copyright piracy and trademark counterfeiting continue to operate in Ukraine. Concerns remain regarding the use of unlicensed software by government agencies. The Cabinet of Ministers adopted a resolution in 2018 requiring government agencies to stop using unlicensed software by the end of 2019. Right holders report that implementation of this resolution over the last two years has been slow. In addition, the U.S. Government will continue to engage with Ukraine regarding implementation of its new patent law, new copyright law reforms, and the operation of the new National IP",60,UKRAINE

Audiovisual Services,"Ukrainian law requires film prints to be produced in Ukraine. According to U.S. industry, this requirement is a significant impediment for distributors of foreign films. In addition, U.S. stakeholders have raised concerns about a recent law that requires dubbing of foreign-language films to be shown on television or through video-on-demand, limits screening of foreign-language films to ten percent of all screenings per month per movie theatre, and applies a 20 percent VAT to the screenings of foreign-language films with subtitles. With respect to cable television, U.S. stakeholders have asserted that a lack of transparency and oversight has allowed cable operators to underreport the number of their subscribers, which allows the operators to underpay for the channels they carry. The United States is working with Ukraine on these issues. In early 2020, the Ukrainian parliament considered the draft law “On Media Registration and Regulation” mandating that traditional and on-demand content providers meet minimum local- or European-content thresholds, register with Ukraine’s National Council of Television and Radio Broadcasting, and submit new content to the Ministry of Culture to ensure it complies with a series of restrictions on materials deemed culturally and politically subversive. However, the current text of the draft law exempts foreign studios, as well as video on-demand providers, from the law’s requirements.

Privatization,"The State Property Fund of Ukraine oversees the technical aspects of the privatization process in Ukraine, while the Cabinet of Ministers handles the strategic aspects of this process. In March 2018, Ukraine passed a new privatization law that was widely welcomed as a substantial improvement over previous legislation. The 2018 law ensures that in nearly all cases, the government will hire reputable international advisory firms to run the privatization process in a transparent manner. The Ukrainian Government has vowed to implement a series of major privatization reforms, including a dramatic reduction of the number of state- owned enterprises previously deemed strategic and exempt from sale. As a first step, the Ukrainian parliament voted in October 2019 to nullify legislation from 1999 banning the privatization of a lengthy list of state assets, leaving only a short list of companies (state-owned entities and strategic infrastructure) to be barred from privatization. The Ukrainian parliament has not yet approved the new list. The United States has provided significant technical assistance to Ukraine to support an open and transparent privatization process.",60,UKRAINE
OTHER BARRIERS,Corruption,60,UKRAINE
Corruption,"Businesses in Ukraine have long suffered from abusive investigative activities by Ukrainian law enforcement personnel, and Ukraine’s court system offers little protection from corruption and abuse. Business complaints mainly concern the unlawfulness of law enforcement agencies’ actions, abuse of power, corruption, and unlawful pressure. To address those concerns, the Government of Ukraine has, among other steps, considered forming a single unified body that would replace the notoriously corrupt Tax Police and take over investigation of economic crimes from the State Security Service and the National Police. To that end, the Ukrainian parliament is considering a draft law “On the Economic Security Bureau” related to the creation of a new unified investigative body. However, in its current form, the bill does not fully reflect the recommendations of international stakeholders. Specifically, there are concerns related to the proposed bureau’s operational independence and accountability. There is a significant risk that if the draft law is adopted in its current form, the agency will replicate some of the problems of the tax police it is intended to replace and fail to deprive the State Security Service of its economic crime investigative functions. In another step to address corruption in Ukraine, in June 2018, the Government of Ukraine created the High Anti-Corruption Court of Ukraine (HACC). The court issued its first sentence in October 2019. As of the end of August 2020, the HACC has issued 16 convictions (15 guilty verdicts and one non-guilty verdict) but only eight convictions have been finalized; the rest are currently being appealed. In late October 2020, however, an adverse ruling by the Constitutional Court of Ukraine striking down the asset declaration law has brought into question the future of Ukraine’s anti-corruption efforts.",60,UKRAINE

Since May 2017, the Ukrainian Government has required an export license for anthracite coal exports because Ukrainian thermal power plants consume primarily this coal grade and the majority of domestic coal production remained in Russia-controlled territories in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Government has eliminated most export duties, with the notable exception of duties on natural gas, livestock, raw hides, some oilseeds (in particular sunflower seed, flaxseed, and linseed), ferrous scrap metal, and raw timber. 518 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS",60,UKRAINE

GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT,"U.S. companies continue to raise concerns regarding the general lack of transparency in the UAE’s government procurement processes, as well as lengthy delays and burdensome procedures to receive payment. In response to the delays in payment, in June 2019, the Abu Dhabi Government announced a rule requiring all public sector and state-owned entities to pay suppliers and contractors within 30 days of the date of receiving invoices. In 2020, the Abu Dhabi Investment Office (ADIO) issued new Public-Private Partnership (PPP) procurement regulations to support greater collaboration between the private and public sectors in the emirate of Abu Dhabi. The regulations followed an announcement earlier in 2020 that the Abu Dhabi FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 523 Government would tender approximately $2.72 billion in infrastructure partnership projects across a range of sectors, including education, transport, and municipality. ADIO also published a “Partnership Projects Guidebook” highlighting PPP procedures for partnership projects in Abu Dhabi. In May 2020, the Ministry of Finance (MoF) issued three decisions reducing fees payable to Federal entities across UAE, including: Council of Ministers Resolution No. 36 on registering in the Federal Supplier Register, Resolution No. 37 amending procurement regulations for federal tenders, and Resolution No. 38 amending fees for services provided by the Ministry of Infrastructure Development. These resolutions reduced fees to register in the MoF’s Federal Supplier Register by 50 percent, from $272.25 to $136.13; cancelled renewal fees; and cancelled fees for submitting tender documents to federal entities. The UAE generally provides a 10 percent set-aside for domestic small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and a 10 percent price preference for GCC goods in federal government procurement. Companies must be at least 51 percent UAE-owned to participate in federal government procurement, except for major projects or defense contracts. The UAE also provides a 10 percent price preference to environmentally friendly or “green” companies and to “green” commodities and services produced in the UAE. In 2020, the UAE Government boosted its procurement support for SMEs to address the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on SMEs. In April 2020, Abu Dhabi Government earmarked 15 percent of procurement spending and annual contracts to micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). The Dubai Government provides a set-aside for SMEs and requires that all Dubai Government entities and companies, in which the Dubai Government has at least 25 percent ownership, provide preferences for MSMEs that include a registration fee exemption, a 10 percent set-aside, a discounted rent of 5 percent for entities in commercial centers and a 5 percent price preference. Foreign defense contractors continue to raise concerns about satisfying contractual obligations through a Tawazun Economic Program Agreement (TEPA) as administered by the Tawazun Economic Council (TEC). The TEPA is colloquially referred to as an “offset agreement” by defense contractors, and despite TEC’s recent reforms of the program as reflected in the 2019 Tawazun Economic Program Policy Guidelines, satisfying offsets in the UAE remains a challenge for U.S. defense contractors. TEC requires defense contractors with contracts valued at more than $10 million to establish commercially viable joint venture projects with UAE companies yielding profits equivalent to 60 percent of the contract value within a seven-year period. Certain projects can be granted a grace period as a result of their complexity, sophistication, or infrastructure requirements. Financial obligations are assessed on the expected growth cycle of a project at the end of each year of the program. Foreign defense firms must submit a bank guarantee equivalent to 8.5 percent of overall outstanding obligations to cover potential failure to satisfy offset obligations. TEC has announced it will begin evaluating tenders based on the potential offset value associated with a contract. Once approved by TEC, offset projects can fall under the UAE defense conglomerate, EDGE. Abu Dhabi National Oil Company’s (ADNOC) In-Country Value (ICV) Program requires suppliers to provide an ICV certificate demonstrating their plans for local content and hiring as part of their bids. ADNOC considers the ICV score when awarding contracts. In 2020, the UAE expanded their ICV program by signing contracts with a number of UAE Government-affiliated or UAE Government-owned companies. On February 25, 2020 Abu Dhabi Department of Economic Development (ADDED) and ADNOC signed a Memorandum of Understanding to standardize ADNOC’s ICV certification program across the Abu Dhabi Government’s procurement process, establishing a unified ICV certificate for the Abu Dhabi Government’s commercial evaluation process of goods and services procurement.

The National Media Council created an Electronic Media Activity Regulation Resolution establishing a legal structure for licensing any entity involved in “E-Media.” The resolution applies to UAE residents and social media influencers operating in the UAE, including all influencers who use their accounts to promote and/or sell products. The law requires the account owner to obtain a license for activities that include “any paid or unpaid form of presentation and/or promotion of ideas, goods, or services by electronic means, or network applications.” It also requires influencers to identify sponsored and/or paid content on their social media channels. The private sector has raised concerns that the law is selectively enforced and overly broad, and that it may inhibit social media influencers based outside of the UAE from participating in the UAE digital economy.

The UAE maintains measures that discriminate against app-based transportation services, including an outright ban on such services in certain emirates.

Vietnam requires foreign content providers to secure FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 547 the services of a local editing company for post-production work, including translation, content review, and payment of a placement fee for advertisements to be approved for placement in a Vietnamese broadcast. Since 2019, the Authority of Broadcasting and Electronic Information (ABEI) under the Ministry of Information and Communications (MIC) has been drafting revisions to Decree 06/2016 designed to extend Vietnam’s broadcasting regulatory regime to Internet-enabled subscription video services. Though still in draft form, the proposed revisions to the Decree have created concern among stakeholders about the onerous regulations for licensing, local presence, local content quota, pre-editing and translation, and advertising. Through several rounds of consultations under the TIFA and other advocacy channels with Vietnam, the United States has requested MIC to address concerns raised by stakeholders.

Retail Services,"Foreign investors who seek to open additional retail establishments beyond the first store in Vietnam’s retail sector are subject to an economic needs test, which is conducted by local authorities and approved by MOIT. In January 2018, MOIT issued Decree 09/2018/ND-CP, which provides additional details on the application of the economic needs test. The criteria include a market analysis, impact assessment of a new retail outlet in terms of traffic, hygiene, competition to nearby traditional markets, and contributions to socio-economic development. Retail outlets of less than 500 square meters located in shopping malls are exempt from the economic needs test requirement.",64,VIETNAM
Financial Services,"Foreign investors may establish 100 percent foreign-owned bank subsidiaries, or may take ownership interests in domestic “joint stock” banks (i.e., commercial banks with any percentage of private ownership) or “joint venture” banks (i.e., banks set up by joint venture agreement, typically between domestic and foreign partners). Total equity held by foreign institutions and individual investors in domestic joint stock banks is limited to 30 percent, while total equity held by a foreign strategic investor (defined by Vietnam as a foreign credit institution meeting certain criteria related to capacity to help develop the Vietnamese banking partner) is limited to 20 percent. Foreign equity in joint venture banks is limited to 50 percent. Over the last two years, foreign banks have raised concerns about provisions in the Law on Credit Institutions, which limits the lending of foreign bank branches in Vietnam based on their local charter capital, rather than on the global capital of the parent bank.",64,VIETNAM
Telecommunications Services,"Vietnam permits foreign participation in the telecommunications sector, with varying equity limitations depending on the sub-sector. For instance, for domestic companies that provide basic telecommunication services with infrastructure, foreign ownership is generally capped at 49 percent; for companies that supply telecommunications services without infrastructure, foreign ownership is capped at 65 percent. Vietnam allows foreign ownership of up to 70 percent for virtual private network (VPN) suppliers and for ASEAN- nationality companies providing value-added telecommunication services without infrastructure. Facilities-based operators are required to be State-controlled firms, meaning that the State, through the relevant line ministry, must hold 51 percent or more of equity.",64,VIETNAM
BARRIERS TO DIGITAL TRADE,Data Localization Requirements,64,VIETNAM
Data Localization Requirements,"Vietnam’s National Assembly passed the Law on Cybersecurity (LOCS) in June 2018. Article 26 requires online firms to store personal and other types of data and to establish branch or representative offices in Vietnam. The LOCS also establishes new restrictions related to online content. Vietnam is currently drafting implementing measures. A draft decree released in July 2019 would narrow the applicability of the LOCS’s local data storage and local presence requirements somewhat by making those requirements applicable only if a service is used to violate Vietnamese law and the service supplier fails to comply with relevant legal requirements, such as a 24-hour takedown requirement for a wide array of proscribed online content. However, as a wide range of digital services that are routinely supplied on a cross-border basis remain potentially subject to these requirements, the draft decree remains problematic. A recent version of the draft decree would also require all domestic companies to store data onshore, which could prevent U.S. cloud services providers from providing services on a cross-border basis to Vietnamese firms. The United States is concerned that implementation of the LOCS could disrupt international trade in services, and has submitted several rounds of comments to the Ministry of Public Security (MPS), which is drafting the decree. The United States will continue to engage the Government of Vietnam to ensure that implementing measures for the LOCS do not disrupt international trade in services.",64,VIETNAM
